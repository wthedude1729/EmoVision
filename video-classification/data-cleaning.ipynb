Thomas Gaits The second stage of the awakening is anger. When you start to see that you are fooled, you react violently for being taken for a fool and you want to lash out. This action is ineffectual in bringing about positive change for the freedom movement. In my experience, those that propose violence are probably working for the government just trying to find some sucker to frame. Anger is a very natural reaction and is one that you must go through rather than suppress. Finding out how the world really works is akin to finding out your significant other has been cheating on you. You may have remained faithful to what this country was about while atrocities were committed behind your back. Anger is just covering up the fact that you are really hurt for being taken advantage of. This stage is often the shortest, but it is also the one with the most energy is expended. In my anger stage, I redirected my anger to fuel an intense amount of research into making sure that I was never fooled again. It eventually led to the creation of this project.\n","Do you know how to get to Harrison High School? Yeah I don't wanna get in trouble with the cops. Hamilton what? Alright.

Nah, I dunno about those guys. I dunno. So Nadi's done what she's can for now. I dunno when I'm gonna be allowed another mission again. So I'm bored out of my mind. And Zaka keeps coming around and bothering me thinking I need company. Yeah. So. Nothing I can do. I'm gonna say this- This feel's a little weird, I mean. What have you done to him? Yeah, um. Don't waste your breath. Or your energy. He sealed it. That guy. The one who did my knee in? Yeah. He used some kind of jutsu and locked my katana. He didn't realize though, I had another one. And a scroll so. This one is fine. Where did actually put the seal on it? I don't know. That's the problem. Lemme have a look at it. I think it's on the inside of the sheath. I'll get Kakashi to look at it later. You might be able to bring it out with the resurgence wand but. I mean sometimes you can just. I mean if you just- If it's on the top then it's fine but if it's put down here then it might break the blade, there might be a trick in the seal that'll break the blade. I know that's what I'm worried about because sometimes you can just pull them but OH DO THAT! Exactly. There might be a bomb in it as well. Oh well. That's why you need the resurgence wand. If you don't get a resurgence on it to find out what kind of seal it is, then you're screwed. I like this katana. Ever since my actual uchiha one was destroyed and I got these. I actually kinda like these. This one's a little bit much better balanced. Not that it matters because I'm not going to get to use them any time soon because I'm banned from missions and I've been told not to train too much. I've been told not to train at all, apparently I've done too much, I don't know why. Not saying they do apparently, I'm just taking up too much time or something, I don't know. I'm bored! I'm bored out my brain! You're not the only one, trust me. So why are you here then? I thought maybe you'd know of something to do. Can't go anywhere, not like there's anything exciting in the village anyway. Not unless you want soccer to drag you to the festival. No, I think she's trying to bring the festival to me because... I refused to wear crutches but I'm... It's kind of hard to walk at the moment, as much as I hate to admit that. So we're not racing or anything, because you would win and that wouldn't be fair. Could probably go find something to do though. There's got to be something. I mean, how big is your estate? It's mostly empty. Exactly! There's meant to be something, somewhere. Err... maybe we should just... I don't know... go watch a movie or something... I don't know... Like what? I don't know, Naruto. I'm just... I'm bored out of my mind, and I'm sore and pissed off. OK, let's go find something to do... Come on! Why are you using your sword as a crutch? Maybe... It works. This is good. I'm not dying, this is good. Can I stand on this? You can stand on that one, yeah. Uh, ooooh this is a bad idea. There's a long way down. What if we trip and fall, or the beams fall out? Give me a whistling hour, Turner. Come on, get out of my way. aggressively moaning Plop! The stump is moving! What if there were birds nesting up here? There aren't any birds. Are you sure? What about bats? We had bats a while ago, but- the bat was taken care of. I can hear wind howling. Of course you can, we are on a roof. Isn't- I would like to get out of the roof, before the roof collapses. The roof's not gonna collapse. I WAS NOT MADE FOR HIGH PLACES! Alright, down ya go. Nooo, I can't go down just yet because- we've got to finish what we were doing up here and then I can go down! Blech! Woah! I'm fine. This book is really dumb. Jeez, how many books have you got up here? Uh, a lot. I like to read. This is a crime! Action, attraction! Oh wow, I haven't played that game in years. I used to love that one as a kid. Take it! I can't believe we're up in my attic looking for board games. Well, we're bored and when you're bored, you play board games. Is that why they're called board games? No. No. It's because they're actually not a board. Stupid question, ignore me. I'll go down and you can hand me those board games, OK, Norto? OK. Why do we have to put the ladder like this? You're an idiot. Cause I can't jump down like you can. It's that easy! What, what did you do? Are you OK down there? I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. And he calls ME an idiot? Hey, I've heard that. Ow. Hey, which idiot jumped down on his broken knee. Ow now my foot hurts. Ow. It actually does. This is all your fault Dobie. Why's it my fault? Because you suggested going up to the attic in the first place. Ow. Aw shut up Marzo. When you come down here, I'm gonna beat you to a pulp. You mean if he can stand up. Yeah. Ow. Ow. Hurry up Dobie, I can't stand up. You're a moron. You're an actual moron. Yeah well that comes like, hand in hand with being your best friend. You cheeky... What possesses you to jump down on a broken knee? I forgot about it. How do you forget a broken knee!? I don't. Shut up Marzo! This sucks. You are a fucking idiot, you know that. Shut up Marzo. Here, I brought you books. You like books, you read books, you moron. I've already read all of these. So read it again! I don't want to read right now. But you read one! Fine. I will read this one. Read a book? I didn't know you could read. Oh this sucks. It was your own fault for jumping out of the roof on a broken knee. What's that word mean? What word? Sailed. Oh right. As in a boat. Right, OK. What does that word mean? Fetch. As in you go to fetch something? Oh Marta you're an idiot. How did you say that? Oh my god! Let's do something else. What can we do with your broken leg? Well I got the board games down so maybe we could play one of them. Go get them! Fine! OK so, what do you do with this stupid thing? Do you.. I've never played this before, you'll have to tell me how to play this. It's dead easy Naruto, you have these weird magnetic marble things and you place them on... I want the blue ones. I want the orange ones! No! You can either get orange or blue and I say orange! I want the orange! I want the red. Fine, I'm having the white ones, and the yellow ones. I don't want the green ones! I want the green ones! Fine I'll have the green ones. Great! You've got two of my family colours. But you've got one of mine! Which one? The yellow! Yellow is hardly in your family. It is! It's just the colour of your hair, red and white Uchiha fan. F Roll. There! Awesome. Right. So you just place a marble... Do we have to put this on the Easy Setting? Do you want to put it on the Hard Setting? If it's for children! Yes, but you're playing. I take offence to that. You're supposed to. Right so I just stick a marble on? Yes. There. Any colour? Yeah. You're such a hopeless loser. So what if I do those? They're out, you're losing already. Oh fuck. Naruto! Why did I not get it in this game? They're magnets, moron. What's the point of it?! Oh my god, you really are hopeless. Ow, what was that for?! Don't laugh at me, I've never played this before! You've gotta put them all on the points without getting them all stuck together. You could've told me that! You never gave me the chance. I thought you would last more than one shot before you set them off. So here that's yours and that's yours so they're all out so you're losers. This is played like not even- Let's just play! Just play! Sorry, I spapped there. Oh, blood! Ha! Oh, my turn, right? Okay. Ha ha! Damn it! I'm still doing better than you are. You're going to still set one off any second now. Ohh! You! You cripple! You're not a cripple! You're just stupid! Get off of me already! Get off! I'll throw this at your knee! Ow! I don't think we should play this anymore. Never gonna lie.\n","I decided to eat only half of the acid at first, but I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red wool and shirt Well, all those white stuff on my sleeve Is LSD Work professor With a bit of luck his life was ruined forever Always thinking just behind some narrow door and all his favorite bars men in red wool and shirts Are getting incredible kicks from things you'll never know\n","music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music Hi guys!

How many missions is that now? That's like eight in a row. I mean, I like working, but that's too many. And then I found out I didn't even need to be on one of them. But you went along anyway, didn't you? Yeah, it's extra money. I hope. So Nadi's gonna kill you because she has to pay you now, and you know what she's like with money. Yeah, I'll just gamble it back for her. She'll be fine. Well, at least you can go out on missions. Like Stillborn or Ninja? Yeah. Bastard Ninja. Where was he from again? What? Where was he from? Land of Lightning, I think. Yeah. Land of Lightning. No. I don't like those guys. So Nadi's done what she can for now, but I don't know when I'll be allowed another mission again. I'm bored out of my mind. And Sokka keeps coming round and bothering me, thinking I need company. Yeah. So. Nothing I can do. Screw this. This feels a little weird. What have you done to him? Yeah. Don't waste your breath or your energy. He sealed it. That guy. The one who did my knee in. Yeah. He used some kinda jutsu and locked my katana. He didn't realise though I had another one in a scroll so. This one is fine. Where did he actually put the seal on it? I don't know, that's the problem. Let me have a look at it. I think it's on the inside of the sheath. I'll get Kakashi to look at it later. You might be able to bring it out with the resurgence one, but... I mean sometimes, I mean if he's put it around the top then it's fine but if he's put it down here, then it might break the blade. There might be a trick in the seal that would break the blade if you pull it out. I know, that's what I'm worried about, because sometimes you can just pull them. Don't do that! Exactly. There might be a bomb in it as well. Oh well. That's why you need the resurgence one, if you don't get a resurgence one to find out what kind of seal it is then you're screwed. I like this katana. So, ever since my actual uchiha one was destroyed and I got these two I actually kinda like these. This one is a little bit much better balanced, but not because it matters because I'm not going to get to use them any time soon, because I'm banned from missions and I've been told not to train too much. I've been told not to train at all because apparently I've done too much, I don't know why. That's just a walk. Not unless you want Saka to drag you to the festival. No, I think she tried to bring the festival to me because I refused to wear crutches but it's kinda hard to walk at the moment. As much as I hate to admit that. So we're not racing or anything, cause he would win and that wouldn't be fair. We could probably go find something to do though. There's got to be something, I mean how big is your estate? It's mostly empty. Exactly! There's got to be something somewhere. Maybe we should just, I don't know, go watch a movie or something, I don't know. Like what? I don't know Naruto, I'm just, I'm bored out of my mind and I'm sore and pissed off. OK, let's go find something to do, come on! Are you using your sword as a crutch, maybe? It works! This is good, I'm not dying, this is good. Can I stand on this? You can stand on that one, yeah. Come on, this is a bad idea, that's a long way down, what if we trip and fall or the beams fall and... Don't be a wuss, come on, get out of my way. The stuff is moving! There are birds nesting up here! There aren't any birds. Are you sure? What about bats? We had bats a while ago, but the bat was taken care of. I can hear a wind howling. Of course you can, we are in a roof. See, now I'd like to get out of the roof before the roof collapses.

I can't believe we're up in my attic looking for board games. Well we're bored. When you're bored you play board games. Is that why they're called board games? No. Let's close it, I'm actually out of boards. Why do you have to ask me stupid questions Normy? Right I'll go down and you can hand me down those board games ok Norko? Ok. Why do I have to put the ladder like this? You're an idiot. I can't jump down like you can. Dead easy. What? What did you do? Owww. Are you ok down there? I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. Oww.

You jeated, what possessions do you have down on a broken knee? I forgot about it. Don't you forget a broken knee? I know. Shut up, Narto! This sucks. You are a fucking idiot, you know that? Shut up Narto. Here, I brought you books. You like books, read books, you moron! I've already read all of these So read it again! I don't want to read right now. Well what do you- Why don't you read one? Fine. I will read a book. I didn't know you could read. Oh this sucks! It was your own fault for jumping out of the roof on a broken knee. What does that word mean? What word? Sailed. Oh right. As in a boat. Oh right, okay. What does that word mean? Fetch. As in, you go to fetch something. I thought you were an idiot. How did you say that one? Oh, my god. Let's do something else. Well, what can we do with your broken leg? Well, I got the board games down, so I don't know, maybe we can play one of them. Go get them. Fine. Okay, so what do you do with this stupid thing? I've never played this before. You'll have to tell me how to play this. It's dead easy, Naruto. You have these weird magnetic marble things and you place them on. Okay, I want the blue ones. I want the orange ones. No. You can either get orange or blue. I want the orange. Right, okay, we'll do the blue ones. Okay, I want the red. Fine, I'm having the white ones and the yellow ones. I don't want the green ones. Well I don't care, you're getting the green ones.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake. But in fact, she is sleepwalking. She has roused, gone into her kitchen, and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a 1997 poll of over 4,000 people in Britain found that 2 in every 100 experience some form of night violence. What we're doing here is really defining a third area of being. We're saying there's sleep, there's waking, and there's something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake-looking behavior that's not fully awake. Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. Don't do that.\n","The News 8 crime fighters helped police with manhunts by airing mugshots on our news cast. For this story we hit the road with a group of state agents who helped get the bad guys off our streets. Hands in the air! Hands in the air, straight up! This is the type of operation officers trained for, a police hot stop on a van in Bonita. Come on out of the car and keep those hands up! One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest, National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents, the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later... The plan for this case is that we're going to go out and we're going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybody's name is listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. Cultivation of marijuana, DUI, threat and terror, crime to terrorize, DV, position of explosive device, and drug related offenses. First stop on this day, a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. We're just waiting for us 1 to come out in any vehicle. The News 8 Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. We've got him for burglary and a robbery but we don't know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Steger, a parole agent with 28 years experience. Every once in awhile you'll find somebody whose brain is absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly a friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents follow the driver tracking him to another home. Car took off East. A short time later the driver takes off at a high speed. Since he's not wanted for a crime, the agents let him go. The target's name is Charles Armstrong. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. They're looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Encanto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the resident's permission but no luck, the sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well they found the brown van in Bonita so now they're calling for our assistance. Agents hook up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspect's van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off at the pass. Alright, they're moving in now. The agents move in, working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspects and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. As far as the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from that van and the clearing of the van, it couldn't have gotten any better than that. Bottom line, nobody got hurt. For agent Stager, that's a job well done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. They're the best. We're just the best. Five parole agents make up the fugitive apprehension team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

To the units that are with the three vehicles, let's make a plan, here. Let's take one of those vehicles. They're going to be straight south on this two-track, but let's make a little path where we can cut them off to the west or to the east. Bring a vehicle down that two-track and turn left, and let's get on the east side of them. Then we'll put agents on the west side of them, and then we'll go in from there. So half of you make a left, and hook them down the tree line, and then the others hold there for just a minute. Okay, you four agents, just stay right now on that tree line and follow that tree line south. Yeah, you four can go south from there. Go south down the tree line. How many are with the vehicle still? Is there more than one agent? There's going to be two agents. Do you want more with the vehicle? But we need the ones that are going to make the jump with the vehicle. They'll be closer. Okay, you guys on the east side, you three, you're almost going to be parallel with them. Go another 10 yards and stop, and then the agent's coming down the west side. This is looking real good. You agents on the east side, you three, stop where you are, 90 degrees right, and they're going to be straight in. Be ready when the jump happens. They're going to come to you if they jump, agents moving south as a team of 6, 20 yards to your left. Watch your radio. You're going to be getting close. Keep coming down. Can you jump us so I can turn my lights on? Yeah, we have a bit of radio. Go ahead, agent. OK, you guys coming south, you got bodies 10 yards into your left, and then about 10 yards forward and in. There you go, keep coming. OK, fan out right there and go straight in. Straight in left, that's where your bodies are. They're all in there. Straight in. Spread out pretty wide. They're all spread out. Yep, you got something right there to your left. Got a group, then keep pushing in, there'll be more. You got runners coming to the east side. They're actually going south. You got two runners going south now. South. Now they're going east. Just go parallel them down the two track. They're staying in the trees. But just, there you go guys, you're paralleling them. Keep running down the two track. Keep running down the two track. No, don't turn in yet. Keep going south. You guys, you two on the east side, keep running south. You're paralleling them. Keep going. Keep going south. They're 10 yards ahead of you, but they're still running south. You're parallel to them. Keep moving south. Keep moving south. You are even with them. Turn in now. Turn in now. Turn back west. They're headed... Ok unit in the vehicle, unit in the vehicle, you're almost even with them. Come up some more. They're coming right to you. Stop. Stop. Straight out your driver door.

Yeah keep going straight, agent. Keep going straight. Keep going straight. Five yards. Five yards. You should see his feet low and to your right. Low and to your right. There's another agent on top of him now. He's laying down. There you go. Right there. Do you see him in there? The agent, right across from the one with one in custody. He's at your feet. There you go. You got him. Yeah, I do have another one. I've got another one now. Okay. The two agents on the east side. You both have. Yep, one just stopped. There's two of you. Yes. You with your left arm up. You're going to be closest. Stand by just a second. Let me get him again. Come on. Let's go. There you are. Okay. Agent that had your arm up. Walk south on the two track, about five yards for me, and stop. Walk south on the two track. Keep walking south. Keep walking south. Stop. Right there. Turn right and go straight in. He's going to be prone. It's just real tough to see him, but go straight in from where you are. Agent, walking up behind the mobile unit. You have a body. Never mind. I'll get somebody else. You guys just walk straight in. You'll be on him. We've got agents walking in from the east side now. You two, if you can find a way in there. Y'all are the closest. Yeah, okay. The agent that's behind the patrol unit on the west side, stop. Yes, you. You're even with the body. You can move east. Move straight in. Okay, the agent that's coming from the east, go right a little bit. Straight in. More to your right. This agent closer to us, turn right. Now, go straight west. I know we're sticking in there. He's at the base of a tree. You two that are together, kind of veer to your right a little bit. Where the lights at? Where at? Okay, right, right, five yards, seven yards, straight in front of you. Straight in front of you, laying down with his head against a tree. Walk straight in, like, five more yards. Little to your left. Little to your left. Got one more. Okay. Okay, I think I may have one more. Stand by just a second. To the two agents on the east side, both of them have their flashlights in their right hand. If you can, move north along that tree line for me. Okay, you two agents, you're straight in now. If you can go straight in towards the original jump. It's getting back to about four o'clock. I'm just, just, probably 20 yards north of the patrol vehicles. Oh, okay, 20 yards north. Yeah, 104. Gotcha. Good line now, 10 yards. Good line, 10 yards. Okay, go a little to your left. A little to your left, more to your left. About 10 o'clock. Five, seven yards. Five yards. Keep coming. Keep coming. A little to your left. A little to your left. Three to five yards in that thick stuff right there. Right there, your eyes are on them. There may be more than one there. Yeah, there is. Use caution. Okay. Two. Got them both? Three. Crap. No, two. Okay. Tony? Two. I'm sorry. The radio broke up. Okay. 10-4.

Ah!\n","Right now we're gonna go on the walking dead Terra tram Welcome aboard the terra tram everyone Passengers, please make sure you drag your bodies over to the right hand side of the tram so you can get as many bodies onboard Alright guys, are you ready to go out there for the Terra tram? I don't know, that didn't sound like you were ready. Let's try that one more time. Are you guys ready?! Alright, okay guys, wave good bye! You are never going to see them again! Now, we're going to head out here on our Terra tram adventure. We just want to make sure you guys stay safe. Keep your arms and legs inside the tram unless you plan on leaving them behind. and if you're silly enough to rings your windows too, make sure to place them in the center of the roads, keeping them away from the side gains. and if you have an emergency of any kind pull that cord out of the center of the tram and I'll come back to assist you. Now enough of that, let's head down to the mini crane guys! There's a big zombie outbreak, shall I say, an epidemic? It started on the west coast and is out here now. and guys pay attention, seriously, this might save your life. Here's a little bit more information. They say it started in Atlanta... Some kind of virus, maybe... and the windows are shut. One day you wake up and the world has changed. Whatever it is, it's quite fast. Whole cities have gone to run... and returned to their own yards overnight. Those who fell became like them... and added to their numbers. The government tried to stop it. They failed... but they ended up like they came unstuck. Those that underwater did their best to survive... but they had to learn a few things. If there's just one legitimate way to get away from the threat... the workers can't be killed... or destroy their body... or even just destroy their water... they don't get any beds. The problem is how often they travel in packs, like herds of hungry animals. Sometimes dozens sometimes more. There's no room for that. The epidemic has reached the West Coast. The walkers have arrived. The world has changed. It belongs to the dead now. Let's make our move right now. Alright guys, well as I mentioned the epidemic has come out here to the West Coast. It was starting to invade the studio. Luckily we had a group of security guards who have survived. Now they are helping to hold down the fort and their sunk out in this next area. However, they are getting a little, well trigger happy lets say. They pretty much will shoot anything that moves and that may include you. Now it looks like, oh no, something must have happened. It looks like the news around here, they are covering something here. Who knows what is going to happen guys but you know what I don't know. You know what I don't think you can go any further just up here. I think we should let them, hey Tammy can we let these guys out here. We are going to be just fine. If I say we I just mean you because I am not getting under this vehicle. Alright guys it looks like they are ready for your arrival. The sky is stretching that is a very .. uh oh. Um. there's the security guards just go get them guys to make sure they'll be safe. Alright guys have a great time out there. Now get the hell off my trail. Alright. Now stay together. Alright stay together and meet in one piece. Why didn't we meet outside. Fuck! Ahhh! Ahh! Haha. Haha. Hahaha. I thought that maybe if I walked on all sides of the street or something. Like a man.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake, but in fact she is sleepwalking. She has roused, gone into her kitchen and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a 1997 poll of over 4,000 people in Britain found that 2 in every 100 experienced some form of night violence. What we're doing here is really defining a third area of being. We're saying there's sleep, there's waking, and there's something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake looking behavior, but it's not fully awake. Oh, oh wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, don't do that.\n","The News-Egg crime-fighters help police with manhunts by airing mugshots on our newscasts. For this story, we hit the road with a group of state agents who help get the bad guys off our streets. ...straight up! This is the type of operation officers train for. A police hot stop on a van in Bonita. One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest, National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents, the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later. The plan for this case is that we are going to go out and we are going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybody's names listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. ...crime, to terrorize, DV, position of explosive device, and drug-related offenses. First stop on this day, a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. We're just waiting for S1 to come out in any vehicle. The News 8 Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. We've got him for burglary and a robbery, but we don't know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Stager, a parole agent with 28 years experience. Every once in a while, you find somebody who's brain is just absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly, the friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents followed the driver tracking him to another home. A short time later, the driver takes off at a high speed. Since he's not wanted for a crime, the agents let him go. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. They're looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Canto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the resident's permission, but no luck. The sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then, a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well, they found the brown van in Bonita, so now they're calling for assistance. The team took up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspect's van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off of the path. Alright, they're moving him now. The agents move in working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspect and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. Because of the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from the van and the clearing of the van, it couldn't have gotten any better than that. Bottom line, nobody got hurt. For Agent Stager, that's a job well-done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. They're the best. Just the best. Five parole agents make up the Fugitive Apprehension Team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

To the units that are with the three vehicles let's make a plan here. Let's take one of those vehicles, they're gonna be straight south on this two track. Let's make a little path where we can cut them off to the west or to the east so bring a vehicle on that two track and turn left and let's get on the east side of them then we'll put agents on the west side of them and then we'll go in from there. So half of it you make a left and hook them around down the treeline and then the others hold there for just a minute. Okay, you four agents just stay right now on that treeline and follow that treeline south. Yeah you four can go south Go south down the treeline. How many are with the vehicles still? Is there more than one agent? There's going to be two agents. You want more with the vehicles? But we need the ones that are going to make the jump with the vehicle, they'll be closer. Okay, you guys on the east side, you three, you're almost going to be parallel with them. Go another ten yards and stop. Yeah, the agents coming down the west side, this is looking real good. You agents on the east side, you three, stop, where you are. 90 degree right, and they're going to be straight in. Be ready when the jump happens. They're going to come to you if they jump. Agents moving south as a team of six, 20 yards to your left. Watch your radio. You're going to be getting close. Keep coming down. Let me jump up so I can turn my lights on. Okay, you guys coming south. You've got bodies ten yards into your left, and then about ten yards forward and in. There you go, keep coming.

To the agent walking one out, there's one behind you laying down. You're walking one out, there's one back behind you laying down. It's real thick, I can barely see, but go back to where you were.

You should see his feet. Low and to your right. Low and to your right. There's another agent on top of him now. He's laying out. There, you go. Right there. Do you see him in there?

Agent that had your arm up, walk south on the two track about five yards for me and stop. Walk south on the two track. Keep walking south. Keep walking south. Stop. Right there. Turn right and go straight in. He's going to be prone. It's just real tough to see him, but go straight in from where you are. Agent walking up behind the mobile unit. Oh, you have a body. Never mind. I'll get somebody else. You guys, just walk straight in and you'll be on him. We've got agents walking in from the east side now. You two, if you can find a way in there. Y'all are the closest. Yeah, okay. The unit that's... the agent that's behind the control unit on the west side, stop. Yes, you! You're even with the body. You can move east. Move straight in. Okay, the agent that's coming from the east, go right a little bit. Straight in. More to your right. This agent closer to us. Turn right. Now, go straight west. I know it's thick in there.

If you can, move north along that tree line for me. Okay, you two agents, you're straight in now. If you can go straight in towards the original jump it's getting back to about four o'clock. I'm just probably twenty yards north of the patrol vehicles. Oh, okay, twenty yards north. Yeah, ten-four. Got ya. Got good line now, ten yards. Good line, ten yards. Okay, go a little to your left.

I used it my walking holiday in the Andes in South America. It was made by an Aztec tribe. A dead plant. That's not being watered since December the 15th. It once had long, purple leaves and its red berries are used for cough medicine. Some teeth and a glass? Oh, they belong to great aunt Gertrude. Last worn on Saturday night at a beauty party. They're kept in a glass of lemonade. That is a scrubbing brush. Made in Lancashire. It's wooden with 87 tufts of natural bristle. And I have never used it. Put your hands on your skulls because here come the questions. Where was the scrubbing brush made? Where was the red team? Lancashire. Lancashire. You've lit up an eye. When was the plant last watered? Green. Where was the green team? December 15th. Correct. Well done, well done. Well done. On which continent was the walking stick used? Green. That is the green team. South America. Correct. Where were the teeth last worn? Red. That was the red team. Saturday night. Where? To a beauty party. Correct. What colour were the plant's leaves?

You have now opened up a door to a haunted room, inside that room there is a terrible task. If you complete that task, you will be awarded two eyeballs. If you fail that task, the eyeballs will go to the red team. The choice is yours. Do you wanna go in there and try and complete the task, or do you wanna send them in? Play. You're gonna play? Let's go to the shrinking room. Yoo-hoo. Hello. Great-aunt Gertrude here. Behind me are some stone slabs, and on the back of the slabs are some arrows. What the little darlings have to do is place those slabs on the floor with the arrows point to make a path that leads out of the room. They've got two minutes to do it, and I've laid the first one for them. Should their path be, hmm-hmm, broken in any way, then they have to repair it. So, watch out for those walls. A turn of the... Now, don't forget you gotta cross this line. In you go. I'm not going in there. You've got two minutes to get out of this door, starting now. Right, where you gonna go? Where's that one gonna go? Put it down in there. Don't forget, it's point to point. Point-to-point. This is for two eyeballs. Ooh, that's a good one. Point to point. Clean it up, clean it up. There you go. Oh, you got some corkers now. You almost to the door! Watch out for the wall! Right, that one's gotta be laid down, that one's gotta be put down. The wall's coming in! Where you gonna go? What are you gonna do with it? What are you gonna do with it? No, but it's gotta be put down so we can pick another one up and cleaned up. All right, down it goes, down it goes.

Don't forget, you gotta get across this white line. Where? Rebuild it, rebuild it there, clean it up there, point to point, point to point. Don't forget, point to point. Look over there, look over there. You have now, got a minute, exactly a minute to get out. Oh, try to watch out for these, look at that, look at that. It's gotta be done, it's got to get across this line. Two eyeballs, it's the two of them first, it's one balls of the game. Forty five seconds, clean it up over there, over there. Look, it's looking a bit messy, it's looking a bit messy over there, Claire. It's gotta be point to point, like over here, point to point. You're headed off in all sorts of different directions, now, aren't we? Don't forget, you've gotta get across this line in your 30 seconds, it's the two eyeballs. Looks like it's done, yes! You finished! Absolutely superb, I never thought you were gonna get out. Well my little green chickadees were running about like jumping beans in there. I love the way those crushing walls relentlessly demolish their attempts to escape. But they did it in the end, they managed to escape and have won their first two Slippy Slimy Eyeballs. Two to the Greens, none to the Reds yet. There you go, Green Team, your first two eyeballs. Lovely, but don't worry, there are plenty of more Haunted Rooms and plenty of more nerve-racking questions so don't look now. But there appears to be a turnip at the window. Yum yum, my favorite grub. A green sock. I lost the other one last year. Where's it gone? A gingerbread man. Stale, of course. A feather duster. That's never been used in this house as you can tell. An inflatable leg. That's in case I lose my wooden one. Another green sock. Pass me the other sock! To the other green sock. A safety pin. That was on my first-ever nappy. A boomerang. Well, I'll never be able to get rid of that. Right, hands on your skulls because here come the questions. What colour was the sock? Red. That is the red team. Green. Correct. What is the boomerang made out of? Red. Uh, the red team again. Wood. Correct. What was the first object? Red. Ow, the red team again. Planet. Correct. This could be your last question, red team. Concentrate, green team. What was after the second sock? Green. And that is the green team. You know, now I'm gonna have to pass the question over to the red team who are desperate for it. What is it? Safety pin! Incorrect! Well done, then, as you've opened the door to a haunted room. Inside that room there is a terrible task.

Growing up, my love for sports helped me to keep my weight down. It wasn't until after high school that I really began battling obesity, along with a host of medical problems. I saw several doctors who simply sent me home with depression medication and told me to go on a diet. When I married my sweet husband a few years later, I packed on another 60 pounds, putting me at almost 270 pounds. My lowest point came when a doctor told me that we couldn't have children because of my weight and health. No woman wants to hear that. Though I had finally been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism, I used it as an excuse assuming it was my destiny to be fat. I didn't have a big event in my life that made me decide to make a change. I just looked in the mirror one day and wondered why I'd been lying to myself for so long. I asked myself, am I truly happy? Is my marriage thriving? What kind of role model would I be as a mother? I knew I had to make a change, so I braved up and fought back. Now a 130 pound slider and an active runner, I have never been so happy. My marriage is thriving and my energy is incredible. I am proof that it is possible to overcome what may seem like the impossible. Wow, what a doll. Okay, before we ask Emily to come out, we're going to talk with the leader of the Pack Joy Bauer, she is going to tell us more about her eating habits. She is adorable and I love that her newfound passion for health has inspired friends and family to lose weight and increase their health as well. So we're in the midst of the holidays, I wanted to give her some sort of a holiday health So I said, Emily, back in the olden days when you were heavier, what were your absolute favorite fattening fair? Cheesecake! A regular restaurant portion is about 750 plus calories. The palm is bigger than that, it's huge. So I made for her a healthy version. This is a cheesecake dip. It's a fraction of the calories and all I did was, I mixed non-fat cream cheese with a little bit of non-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt, either works. A touch of brown sugar, vanilla extract and cinnamon. And then you can dip it with fruit. And of course, I'll put that out on Twitter and Facebook for our viewers. Next, fettuccine alfredo! What is better than that? This is a heart attack on a plate, right. Over 1400 calories. So in my version for Emily, I took fat-free evaporated, skim milk and I mixed it with a little, light cream cheese and it gives you this creamy, velvety, delicious flavor for a fraction of the calories. Is there pasta in there or is there whole wheat pasta? It's whole wheat pasta. We sauteed mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and some grilled chicken. And you get a hearty portion for under 500 calories. All right, let's look at Emily's. All right Emily, come join the Joy Fit Club! Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! The weight loss took some time. How long did you finally decided that this is the time? How long did it take? It took about a year and a half to two years to lose the weight, but it was probably about a year ago when I really just kicked it into high gear. And you're a runner, you're saying. How did you start that? Slowly. By stepping? Was it a walking thing? Yeah, I couldn't run more than three minutes to start but every day I just went out there and I kept pushing and I kept trying. She gets whistles now. And what does your husband think of this new you? Curtis, you'll get your chance. Curtis is back in the kitchen. Whistling. How's your energy level changed in all the health issues you were concerned about? Amazing, I've got so much energy. It's incredible.

The newest member is 27 year old Emily Pollack. Emily's lost a whopping 130 pounds and it changed her life. Let's take a look at her story. I have always struggled with my weight even as a child. Growing up my love for sports helped me to keep my weight down. It wasn't until after high school that I really began battling obesity along with a host of medical problems. I saw several doctors who simply sent me home with depression medication and told me to go on a diet. When I married my sweet husband a few years later I packed on another 60 pounds putting me at almost 270 pounds. My lowest point came when a doctor told me that we couldn't have children because of my weight and health. No woman wants to hear that. Though I had finally been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism I used it as an excuse assuming it was my destiny to be fat. I didn't have a big event in my life that made me decide to make a change, I just looked in the mirror one day and wondered why I had been lying to myself for so long. I asked myself, am I truly happy? Is my marriage thriving? What kind of role model would I be as a mother? I knew I had to make a change so I braved up and fought back. Now a 130 pound slider and an active runner, I have never been so happy. My marriage is thriving and my energy is incredible. I am proof that it is possible to overcome what may seem like the impossible. Wow, what a doll. Okay, before we ask Emily to come out we're going to talk with the leader of the pack, Joy Bauer. She's going to tell us about her eating habits. She is adorable. And I love that her newfound passion for health has inspired friends and family to lose weight and increase their health as well. So we're in the midst of the holidays. I wanted to give her some sort of a holiday health gift. So I said, Emily, back in the olden days, when you were heavier, what were your absolute favorite fattening fair? Cheesecake. A regular restaurant portion is about 750 plus calories. The palm is bigger than that. It's huge. So I made for her a healthy version. This is a cheesecake dip. It's a fraction of the calories. And all I did is I mixed nonfat cream cheese with a little bit of nonfat sour cream or Greek yogurt, either works, a touch of brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. and you can dip it with fruit. Okay. And of course, I'll put that out on Twitter and Facebook for our viewers. Next, fettuccini Alfredo. What is better than that? This is a heart attack on a plate, right? Over 1400 calories. So in my version for Emily, I took fat-free, evaporated skin milk and I mixed it with a little light cream cheese and it gives you this creamy, velvety, delicious flavor for a fraction of the calories. Is there pasta in there? Wheat pasta? It's whole wheat pasta. It's raw, sauteed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and some grilled chicken and you get a hearty portion for under 500 calories. All right. Let's look at Emily's poor picture. All right. Emily, come join the JoyFit Club. Oh my gosh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wow. Good for you, Emily. You look great. Congratulations. Thank you, ladies. All right. The weight loss took some time. How long did you finally decide that this is the time? How long did it take? It took a year and a half to two years to lose the weight. But it was probably about a year ago when I really just kicked it the high gear. And you're a runner you're saying, right? Yeah. How did you start that? Slowly. Walking. Was it a walking thing first? I couldn't run more than three minutes to start. But every day, I just went out there and I kept pushing and I kept trying. She gets whistles now. When she runs. And what does your husband think of this new you? Curtis, you'll get your chance in a minute. Curtis is back in kitchen. Whistling. Whistling at you. How's your energy level changed? In all the health issues that you were concerned about. Amazing. Fertility and things. I have so much energy. It's incredible. I just had a tech up with my doctor recently. Everything was just fantastic. Wow. I was thinking about Grace. So your chances to be a mother some day are much increased. Yes. Such a great thing. Any advice for people at home who are kind of at the before stage at which you were. Any advice for them? Don't rush it. Don't try and push too hard to start with. Take baby steps. It's going to take time. You're going to plateau. You're going to have rough spots. Don't quit. It works and it happens.

They focus on helping maintain a healthy lifestyle free of addiction. Situated in private, tranquil setting just outside of Annapolis, Maryland, Severity Acres is dedicated to your recovery through our unique one on one treatment approach. Therefore, we only accept a limited number of patients at a time. Our private and semi private suites and rooms assure the most comfortable accommodations and our secluded grounds guarantee the most confidential treatment available. Each individuals treatment is personally designed by our team of medical and addiction specialists to enable the best chance at a full, lasting recovery. Because addiction is personal and unique to each person, they need to receive unique treatment as well. Our founder, Lawrence Adler, has been personally touched by addiction and substance abuse issues. After watching people close to him go through numerous treatment programs that were ineffective, he started researching all other options available. What he found is that most treatment programs are strongly grounded in the single treatment philosophy. Because of these shortcomings, he started working with some of the best addiction and treatment specialists to design a different type of treatment option. Thus, Serenity Acres was born. Serenity Acres' treatment options and plans are as different as each of the patients we treat. Incorporating both Eastern and Western medicine, along with proven therapies, we also follow and encourage the 12-step treatment plan to complement all other modalities of treatment, And because addiction is often caused by an underlying emotional or mental issue, we treat not only the addiction, but the underlying causes, which creates a new way for our patients to see life and their role in the world. Serenity Acres offers many recreational activities, including a swimming pool, ping pong, billiards, shuffleboard, horseshoes and basketball. Patients also go on recreational outings like bowling, the movies, museums and the zoo, just to name a few. Our belief is that a structured yet customizable program is the best way for our patients to begin a lasting recovery. Patients are encouraged to participate in the activities and therapies that will most help them recover. Because recovery is a journey that affects the whole family, we also offer well-rounded family therapy and education sessions. We believe that the more support and understanding a patient has, the greater their chances for success at recovery. Recovery information often leaves the addict and their loved ones in a broken or fractured state. Our goal is to help both the patient and their families to become whole again. Our program includes the following treatment methods. Individual therapy five times per week, group therapy daily, holistic therapies, sauna therapy, 12-step programs, 30-day, 60-day, 90-day options for treatment or a custom schedule depending on the individual. Aftercare is thorough with a detailed plan and customized to each patient. So, if you are ready to take the steps to finally overcome your addiction and give yourself a chance at a lasting recovery then take the first step towards the place that will help you get there. Call us now at 1-800-335-7440 to learn more about the unique recovery options that we offer and how we can help.\n","¶¶ Oh God, grant me the serenity To accept the things that I cannot change The courage to change the things that I can The wisdom to know the difference Oh God, give me the courage To love with an open heart To love with an open heart To love with an open heart I wanna love with an open heart Oh, with an open heart I wanna love with an open heart\n","A lot of people feel like with Joy Behar leaving, they're losing their sister. And she has been there since the beginning. And now Joy Behar, the last original member of The View besides Barbara Walters, is leaving the show. Now, we spoke exclusively with Behar this morning, just moments ago. She tells us, quote, I've put in 16 years and felt the time was right. You're doing a great job today. For a decade and a half, her unique wit. If anyone knew how much Nooky elected officials get we'd be calling Tiger Woods, Senator Wisdom. If people don't get real, we're gonna have the same problem next time and willingness to get well a little wild. Oh man, there's been Japan has brought joy to millions of viewers. But this morning, Joey Behar says she's ready to hang up her coffee mug. What'd I say? Talk to the hands. Later this summer, she'll sign off of a B. C. Signature mid morning broadcast after 16 seasons calling it the right time to say goodbye. Behar has been there since the View launched in 1997. She has been at the center of so many memorable moments from her decision to walk off the set and protests during an interview with Bill O'Reilly to her over the top interviews with President Obama. What's the controversial sex book that's on millions of women's bedside tables? It doesn't know. I don't know that. OK, next. Right sense of humor and amusing mannerisms even earned her the ultimate form of flattery. Being regularly spoofed on Saturday Night Live. You want to say who cares? Let's go home and have a glass of Pinot Grigio. Her has also been a friend to GMA for more than 30 years. And to think that you were a receptionist one at one time here GMA every time I come here, I look like a Vietnam flashback. Sources say Bay Hard knows her departure will be bittersweet. On Thursday, she told deadline com quote. I have a lot of friends there and I will miss everyone I've worked with because we have a family there. So after 16 years Bay Har is spreading her wing. She also tells us quote. You can't stay forever on a show. I'm graciously exiting stage left.

On the other side something unexpected an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was a lost family member perhaps The trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew Elephants Some scientists believe elephants can grieve their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find They fall strangely silent as they fondle the bones It's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds, but such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence Only a fully conscious being can think in such a way Another herd arrives. Immediately our group sets out to greet them For the calf it's his first meeting with distant relatives There is huge excitement as the two families meet The calf is still learning his place in the elephant community Our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society, everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth, one thing we can be sure of dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","My father never said anything. He went to the fields and joined the Jihad. If you are to be killed, then don't you join the Jihad? Two children died. One just suffered from eating, the other died of hunger. The other was agitated and really old. We are just waiting for justice to be served. The parents were disappointed, he committed suicide. He was chasing me and they just killed him. They asked me to keep my kids away from me. They then told me I was a widow I don't know how to protect the children, I don't know when I'll recover. I didn't understand their conditions. They murdered my kids to give me food.\n","I think we live in a society here where people don't really want to accept death. And I try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away about five months ago, and he was an avid runner, he was a cook. So this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors. Opening up doors into your subconscious. Me, using these symbols and using the colors and using the things that I know were close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well, I obviously have experienced my own deaths. And I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know, I want to do a workshop and I developed this one. Using the traditional ofrenda altarp making of Mexico. And creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted.

It can take months, even years, to come to grips with the loss, and in some cases the trauma is so severe that special help is needed. New Jersey Resident Stephanie Moldberg is sharing her very personal story to help others. My son Eric loves sports. He was a funny little boy. He had a lot of friends. He was really kind and sensitive, and he was a happy child. Eric had a wonderful relationship with his sister. They were just 18 months apart, and they spend a lot of time together. And Lauren idolized Eric. So whatever Eric did, she wanted to do. We initially found out that Eric was sick a few weeks after he got home from sleep away camp. He was away for seven weeks, and he came home. And when he got home, he was complaining about pain in his hip. But then a couple of weeks later, it started to become more and more painful. We took him to the doctor. It was a tumor. It was stage four metastasized Ewing sarcoma bone cancer. And they had metastasized to his bone marrow, and we had a long road ahead of us. And I just couldn't believe that the diagnosis of cancer. I mean, kids just don't get cancer. So I sort of just had to move into a different gear. And there's so many doctors that we had to speak to. I was Eric's advocate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. My husband and my daughter didn't believe that Eric was going to die. For me, it was different. I thought that he was going to die when we got the diagnosis. And then the last day, he really didn't speak at all. And Eric's laying down. It's about 10 o'clock at night, and I get into bed. And I'm looking at him like I always did, and I spend a lot of time just staring at him. And then I heard this really deep breath. It was almost like he was just trying to keep on breathing. But actually, it was just saying, I can't do this anymore. And that was Eric's last breath. No, there was a lot of planning after Eric died and funeral was just two days later, and then we sat. And there are a lot of people around. But shortly after that, when everybody sort of leaves and my daughter went back to school, my husband went back to work. I was home by myself a lot, and I didn't know what to do. And everything was foreign to me because for pretty much 16 months I didn't do very much but take care of Eric. And I didn't know how to sort of readjust to life and to reengage in life again. And my days were very, very long. And there was no structure to them. And what happens with people that have a difficult time adjusting after their loss is that they feel like they get stuck in time. That their grief is not progressing. And my grief wasn't progressing. Stephanie was suffering from a condition called complicated grief. It's an intense form of grief that needs specialized treatment. And with us this morning is Stephanie Maldburg and Dr. Catherine Sherr, founder of the Complicated Grief Program at Columbia University. First of all, thank you so much for sharing your very personal story with us. Let's talk about how you even were diagnosed, because it was a long road to even get there. It took me four years to get diagnosed. Actually it was my daughter, she had been seeing a doctor who had seen Dr. Sherr lecture at Columbia University. And Lauren's doctor recognized that I had many of the symptoms that Dr. Sherr had been describing, in complicated grief. And she asked Lauren if I could. She can call, contact me, and she did. And then the following week I had an appointment and I met Dr. Sherr. Dr. Sherr, let's talk about the difference between complicated grief and the grief that many of us are familiar with. Yeah. So I think it's useful to think about loss, losing a loved one, as being a little bit like getting a serious physical wound. In that there's a natural healing process that occurs and it's painful, but the pain diminishes as the healing goes on. And sometimes we know a wound can get complicated. Right? It can be, there can be an infection or trouble with the vascular supply or something like that and when that happens you have to treat the complication to let the wound heal. And the same thing can actually happen with grief. It can get complicated so that it doesn't do that natural healing. And Stephanie was talking about some of the symptoms that, and we put those up on the screen. There are so many different symptoms. Stephanie, let's talk about how the treatment has helped you. It's a 16 week program? Yes. It was very time limited and very structured. And I had been in therapy before but I was avoiding talking about the most difficult things. And that was my loss. And when I met Dr. Cher there was a very, she was very guided and she kept me on track. And I had, I did imaginal revisiting exercises and conversations. Those were really two very helpful tools for me. It helped me progress. And I was so fearful that I was going to forget Eric and the memories that I had of him. And doctor, the person who is going through complicated grief, I'm guessing that person very often does not recognize that in themselves. What advice do you have for people around them that may see it? Well, you know, people gather around people after they lose someone close. They just do that naturally and they provide a lot of support and emotional and practical support, and they don't expect it to be over right away. But, you know, when it starts to, people notice when someone else, months and months have gone by and someone is still experiencing intense, intense emotions and it's disrupting their lives. And their natural inclination at that point is to say, you know, honey, I know this was hard, but, you know, it's time to move on and put this behind you. But we can't put a loss behind us. We have to learn to live with it. And so, you know, really what other people need to realize is that when a person isn't doing that, it's not because they don't want to. It's because there's something really stopping them. And that's, you know, that's when they kind of need help, rather than just pushing, you know? Well, Dr. Shear, thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie, you were saying that Dr. Shear really saved your life. Thank you, Mill. I thought so. Thank you. Now, for more information about complicated grief, head over to our website, cbsnewyork.com. We're back in a moment.\n","It wasn't real. So, I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And I mean we don't really think about it but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance. Oh my god, is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. It just doesn't make sense. No, it does. No, it's not over. I have four years of college to go through. It will be exactly the same. No, it will be completely different. Oh my god, is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. Like I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean school is a part of the real world but I'm assuming that you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case, yeah. No. Come fall semester, I'm just going to show up at any class that I want to. What are they going to do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? It's not a bad thing. I'm not leaving my room until I'm 35 and nursing a child. This sucks. I have to get a real job now! If you want money. I don't need money or material things, all I need is friends and a family. Don't you think you're being a little unrealistic? Don't you think you're being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I don't like new things! I don't do new things! Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay, it's okay. I mean I'll have all the same friends that I do now. I mean we'll stay in touch no matter what. You won't. It's okay, I'll just go to grad school. I mean it's not that expensive. You could do that, I mean if you don't think you're ready for serious employment, go back to school, learn more. Perfect, I just won't turn 30. And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god, everyone's gonna be so far away and I'm gonna be alone! I'm gonna have to talk to people! Yeah, that's kind of something we humans do. I don't have money, how am I supposed to do this?! Student loans? Okay, maybe I'll just hope for a big student loan and I'll spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought. Wow, I forgot about those student loans. I can't afford graduate school, I have to get a job. I hate milkshakes! Ahahaha. Yeah, about that, you'll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. I'm too old to get away with stuff now. Life goes on. I guess I'll just be popular in college. I guess it is over. I'm too old to freeload. Life goes on. But I am still really pissed that there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen, damn it! And yes, I said penis and vagina. They're not bad words, they're body parts. It made me think that just because I graduated college, I should put my hair up. Over it.\n","Elsword Animation Come on, wait up. Who are you? You're... Roxas. How can you be here? Am i dreaming? Come on say something. This could have been the other way around. Huh?

It's been hard to sleep because I usually sleep sometimes with my dad. I feel like my mom is with me because she is an angel. What I'd like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes. And sometimes I dream about him. While my brother was riding a bike, he was hit by a texting driver. The advice I would give to kids who have lost a loved one is talking to people doesn't hurt it actually really helps. What I want people to know is that it's really hard, but you'll get through it. And I know you can. Advice I would give is don't keep it in. You need to talk to someone, because it will just keep building in. It feels like he's everywhere I go, even if he's gone. I just love him so.\n","Who are you? Lillian Jones. I won't hurt you. Please. Maybe. I know you. I'm so sorry. I love you. Goodbye.\n","Come on Rottex. What's the matter? What's wrong?

On the other side something unexpected, an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth, but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was A lost family member perhaps The trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew Some scientists believe elephants can grieve Their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find They fall strangely silent as they fondle the bones It's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds But such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence Only a fully conscious being can think in such a way Another herd arrives Immediately our group sets out to greet them For the calf, it's his first meeting with distant relatives There is huge excitement as the two families meet The calf is still learning his place in the elephant community Our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society Everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth One thing we can be sure of Dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","They lived their life with hatred...

And i try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away. He died 5 months ago and he was an avid runner, he was a cook, so this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors, opening up doors into your subconscious. To me, using these symbols and using the colors and using the things that i know or close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well I obviously have experienced my own deaths and I really did some artwork. I did a painting about 10 years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know I want to do a workshop, and I developed this one using the traditional ofrenda altar making of Mexico and creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother, she's been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom, and the wheat, the staff of life. It's very easy for us as children to pull out crayons, markers, and pens and just start marking up the walls, and we really don't have a sense of judging ourselves in those moments. It's natural.

Well, Dr. Scheer, thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie, you were saying that Dr. Scheer really saved your life. Thank you. My life better. Thank you. Now, for more information about complicated grief, head over to our website, cbsnewyork.com. We're back in a moment.\n","It wasn't real. So I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now, and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And, I mean, we don't really think about it, but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance... Oh my God, is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. It just doesn't make sense. No, no, it's not over. I have 4 years of college to go through. It'll be exactly the same. No, it'll be completely different. Oh my God, is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. Like, I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean, school is a part of the real world. But I'm assuming you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case, yeah. No come fall semester, I'm just gonna show up at any class that I want to. What are they gonna do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? It's not a bad thing. I'm not leaving my room until I'm 35 and nursing a child! This sucks! I have to get a real job now? If you want money. I don't need money or material things. All you need is friends and family! Don't you think you're being a little unrealistic? Don't you think you're being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I don't like new things. I don't do new things. Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay it's okay. I mean I'll have all the same friends that I do now. I mean we'll stay in touch no matter what. You won't. It's okay. I'll just go to grad school. I mean it's not that expensive. You could do that. I mean if you don't think you're ready for serious employment, go back to school. Learn more. Perfect. I just want to turn 30. And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god everyone is going to be so far away and I'm going to be alone. I'm going to have to talk to people. Yeah that's kind of something we humans do. I don't have money. How am I supposed to do this? Student loans. Okay, maybe I'll just hope for a big student loan, and I'll spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought! Wow, I forgot about those student loans! I can't afford graduate school! I have to get a job! I hate milkshakes! Yeah, about that. You'll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. I'm too old to get away with stuff now! Life goes on... Guess I'll just be popular in college. I guess it is over. I'm too old to freeload. Life goes on... But I'm still really pissed there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen, damn it! And yes I said penis and vagina. They're not bad words. They're body parts. 9- 10 years later... And what made me think that just because I graduated college, I should put my hair up? No. Over it.\n","Come on, wait up. Who are you? You're...Roxas!? How can you be here? Am I dreaming? Come on, say something! This could have been the other way around. Huh? But it really has to be you. What do you mean? There are so many hearts that are connected to yours. You're me, so you can feel what I felt. No! Roxas, you're you. We're not the same. I wanted to tell you that. That you deserve as much as I do to be your own person. Sora, see? That's why it has to be you. Not again. Did they cause all this pain? What do you want me to see!? Sora... Don't chase the dreams. They'll lead you nowhere. Just believe in the gifts that you'll never be able to wake up from.\n","you.4\n","Shades of Noir Grief means... every emotion, I think. I felt really sad and didn't want to do anything or talk again. I figured I had to talk. It's been hard to sleep because I usually sleep sometimes with my dad. I feel like my mom is with me because she's an angel. What I'd like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes. And sometimes I dream about him. While my brother was riding a bike, he was hit by a texting driver. The advice I would give to kids who have lost a loved one is talking to people doesn't hurt and it actually really helps. What I want people to know is it's really hard but you'll get through it. I know you can. The advice I would give is don't keep it in. You need to talk to someone because it will just keep building in. It feels like he's everywhere I go. Even if he's gone, I just love him so.\n","Who are you? William Jones. Good morning, Adam. I wont hurt you. Please. But baby, you look fabulous. I knew you. I'm so sorry. Goodbye. You\n","Come on, Protect. What's the matter? What's the matter? I understand. It's too difficult for you.

There is a giant gorilla with a tiny, tiny, tiny helpless kitten and being gentle and loving towards that kitten. Coco rhymed a name for her new kitten. She called him all ball, because to her the cat looked like a little ball. Coco adored all ball and they spent countless hours playing together. And yet it was by loving the little tailless kitten that Coco learned one of life's hardest lessons. One evening, all ball was tragically killed on a nearby logging road. Coco was heartbroken. All ball, hit by a car... I went in right away. I said, Coco, something's happened to your kitty and he won't be here anymore. You know, he's... he's... the cat has died. Penny stayed with Coco to comfort her. And later, privately, Coco expressed her grief.\n","Choir singing\n","poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores\n","I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart Down in my heart And I'm so happy, so happy, so very happy And I'm so happy, so happy, so very happy For being And I can understand And I can pretend That this will be alright in the end So I'll try my best\n","[\"Taeb Tataab\"] [\"Taeb Tataab\"]\n","Carter!

Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? If I don't belong with you Sometimes I know that differences seem chasms we must spend Sometimes you feel you're falling in and grasping for a hand You try to cross the great divide Or trek that you must choose You're caught up in the landslide It's how I'm lost for you Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? If I don't belong with you What do you want? If I don't belong with you What do you want?

If I don't belong with you\n","One last hurdle lies ahead the back is steep and slippery made it On the other side something unexpected an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was a lost family member perhaps the trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew So some scientists believe elephants can grieve their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find they fall strangely silent as they fumble the bones it's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds but such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence only a fully conscious being can think in such a way another herd arrives, immediately our group sets out to greet them for the calf it's his first meeting with distant relatives there is huge excitement as the two families meet the calf is still learning his place in the elephant community our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth one thing we can be sure of Dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","She has no words but cries. My father didn't tell us anything. He had voted for poison. Whoever has to die, they don't come from Jihad. Both the sons died because of poison. Some die from hunger, Some die from cough. We are only yearning for peace. My wife passed away, after comitting suicide by poison. I am left with nothing. People tried to keep the kids away from me. They told me I would be a widow then. My life depends on God now. God knows I would die one day. I committed suicide, but I can't lose my family. And new books have been written the people of a wailing earth The wailing is the country of Punjab The wailing is the country of Punjab Out of the ecstasy of those tears, my sister writes my name Today hundreds and thousands of daughters are weeping and they call me the heir of Glory Today the eyes are tears of Glory of that, who I once was\n","I think we live in a society here where people don't really want to accept death. And I try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away five months ago. But he was an avid runner, he was a cook, so this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors, opening up doors into your subconscious. To me, using the symbols, and using the colors and using the things that I know were close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well, I obviously have experienced my own deaths, and I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago, and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know, I want to do a workshop, and I developed this one, using the traditional ofrenda altar making of Mexico, and creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother. She's been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom, and the wheat the staff of life. It's very easy for us, as children, to pull out crayons, markers, and pens and just start marking up the walls. And we really don't have a sense of judging ourselves in these moments. It's natural. And I enjoy using art therapy with most of my participants because I feel it's a wonderful expression and vehicle for them to process their emotions.\n","Good afternoon, and welcome to our talk tonight.\n","EMPTY\n","Oh his phone hangs between your breaths I hope you haven't pulled it yet And if this little finger doesn't have the strength Then I'm scared that this bird's backbone breaks It's only hope that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is never running dry I wear a ring of your lipstick Around the knuckle of my fourth digit It reminds me what our bodies sewed It will go through until we are betrothed It's only hope that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Space between your navel In your waistband was the ice Where two fingers pirouette But now these handnails they just slice It's on the hardwood that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Never running dry Your tongue that's high, your lips, the shore I am the jets, I'm overboard, Goodbye, courage I christen all the ships that sail, I'm your little kiss, your saliva trail Goodbye courage, hell of sadness again Farewell memories Of new highs and lows Goodbye courage, hell of sadness Hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why This dripping from my broken eye Is never running dry Hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why My broken heart is never running dry I let those forefingers got me Leave me only with my thunder Constantly is pointing down me Emperor besties not friends It's only hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is Never running dry Never running dry\n","Puppy Surprise is having puppies!

How fortuitous, he says, for a species to find in its own ability to contemplate, to marvel at its own existence, has been evolutionarily advantageous. In other words, it has been biologically selected for because it informs our life with a sense of cosmic significance, that makes us work harder to persist and to survive. In other words, awe has helped us survive. And you know, a recent study out of Stanford on the subject of awe kind of validates this idea. They have found that regular incidences of awe leave residual benefits upon the individual that persists, such as increased feelings of empathy and compassion towards others, increased feelings of altruism, and increased feelings of general well-being. In this study, they defined awe as an experience of such perceptual expansion. Such perceptual vastness that you literally have to reconfigure, upgrade your mental schemata just to accommodate, just to take in the scale of the experience. This is amazing. We've all felt this before, the first time we've stared upon the Grand Canyon or succumbed to the immersive power of an IMAX film, but perhaps the most exquisite account of the experience of awe was articulated by the brilliant Ross Anderson when writing about the Hubble Space Telescope. Pay attention, he says that the Hubble has given us nothing less than an ontological awakening, a forceful reckoning with what is, allowing us to contemplate space and time on a scale just shy of infinite. Wild! He says gazing upon the famous Deep Field photograph literally allows us to mainline the whole of time through the optic nerve, to fit something so impossibly large to something so impossibly small. Simple. Incredible. He says through the sheer aesthetic force of its discoveries the Hubble distills the impossibly complex abstractions of astrophysics into these singular expressions of color and light, vindicating Keith's famous couplet, beauty is truth. Truth. Beauty.\n","USGS position target is leaving the building. Over. We'll have eyes on target in one second. Eyes on target now. Target wearing violet top, black skirt, black satchel.

What is the difference? Let's just stay on taxes for a moment. Well but virtually everything you just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. This is about getting jobs for the American people. Jim let me just come back on that on that point which is the small businesses were talking about. Excuse me, just so everybody understands, we're way over our first 15 minutes. Fun isn't it? It's okay it's great. That's all no problem. Jim the President began this segment so I think I get the last word. You're going to get the first word in the next segment. Well but he gets this first word of that segment. Way over the two minutes. Sorry. Putting it forward before Congress right now $4 trillion plan. But you've been president four years you've been president four years make one more point. Let me answer the taxes thing for a moment. Okay. Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He's ruled out revenue? Absolutely. Look Medicaid, schools, oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. But it's real but but the right the right approach is running May... And you don't support that? I don't. Yeah again that's for future I understand. Not for current retirees. Jim if I can just respond very quickly not just in Medicare and Medicaid. Talk about that. But overall. And so... That's that's a big topic... I want to get to it but all I want to do quick very quickly before we leave the economy. Let's get back to Medicare. The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost but my experience my experience is that private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. Can we, can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between you on Medicare? All right. Regulation can become excessive... Is it excessive now do you think? Well in some places yes, other places no. It can become out of date. Leverage limits for institutions... Here's a specific... Let me mention the other, let's talk here the big one... Let's not... But that's not what I believe... That's just not the facts. Now the last point I'd make before... Two minutes is up sir. No I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me... Leaving millions of people out in the cold... Your five seconds went away a long time ago... Well I did with my first statement and I'll go on... Please allow me... These are tough problems and we've got to make choices and the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country. We're gonna move to... Which is which is my experience... They're setting up their training programs... Do you agree, Governor? Let me just finish the point... I suspect it will be very well in my state, by the way... Yeah... We're running out of time... Any chances to respond to that... Mr. President, you're entitled for all of our kids... All right gentlemen, look... Excuse me one second... Excuse me sir... We barely have three minutes left for now... From the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lara... Thank you and good night.\n","this is Lincoln that has snuck up on the bed and now I'm going to try to get him down and you will see what I have to go through every time to try to get him off the bed get down get down get off this bed get off this bed get down get down get down get down don't you growl you get down it's time to wake up you get off the bed it's time to work diggin you just ignore me okay dink you take you get off the bed excuse me excuse me okay wake up okay wake up maybe you'll get off\n","It's okay.

This teacher has a particular student named Chelsea. Chelsea loves Justin Bieber. Tried to buy tickets, they were sold out. Parents tried to buy tickets, they were sold out. The teacher even wanted to try and buy tickets for Chelsea too. Couldn't get a hold of any, so now Chelsea's grade-eight class have been trying to win her tickets from us every single morning and every single afternoon so we've decided to come here and surprise Chelsea and tell her that she's going to Justin Bieber. We have a pair of tickets for her. Now this is super stealth mode, we couldn't come in the Virgin vehicle because everybody would see so we're driving my old blazer, 2000 blazer.. sweet ride.. no one will suspect a thing, although there's four of us in here and the windows are fogging up, but so we're gonna go to the office get the teacher and then Jamie who's recording right now is gonna go into the class pretend that he's helping record some huge announcement when we bust in yo with Bieber tickets. Yeah Chelsea we're coming for you. Don't stop believing. So here's the notorious miss Greenberg who wrote the email telling us about the lovely Chelsea. So here's the background in about what is it 10 minutes or so we're gonna call it a meeting of sorts where we're gonna have about 70 people in a room, you didn't know how to lie to your students? Right. So what did you tell them? I told them that there was a possibility of one of their teachers leaving next week and I managed to put on some fake tears for them so they think that that person is me so they are all prepared for the absolute worst. That's good that's good. That is a horrible story. A horrible lie but good. So tell us a little bit about Chelsea and why you wanted to make sure she got Justin Bieber tickets? Chelsea is the best kid ever she is in French she's what we call the little chouchou she does anything to make anybody happy she is a psycho Justin Bieber fan like it's ridiculous you know like we'll be writing math tests and there will be a question that has nothing to do with Justin Bieber and she will find a way to incorporate him into her answer. She's just, she's a really lovely kid she goes above and beyond with everything she does and she's just so deserving of this and the kids have been trying so hard, the whole class has been trying so hard to help her win these tickets. And so let's say that this is grade eight yeah these are 13 going on 14 year olds so I think that's really amazing you're right that's so rare you have like a whole class of kids that are pulling together to send somebody to go They're all actually wearing purple today because they wanted to take a picture and photoshop Justin Bieber into it and send it to the radio station at lunch as a whole class wearing purple to try and You are kidding? there's 19 kids wearing purple right now oh my gosh yeah I'm so excited I could get sick do you know what I mean there's like so many nerves here I've been feeling like that since last night I haven't slept all night because I'm I've just been so excited for this kid there is gonna be one less lonely girl Chelsea's going to Justin Bieber thank you very much okay let's go do this Good Morning I'd like to introduce Jamie Morning hi guys We have something to share with you Miss Greenberg indicated that this meeting was very important to something so Where is Chelsea? Chelsea Where is Chelesea AHHH Chelsea, hi Chrissy this is LTI So we are so You guys We are so impressed We think you guys are the best You guys are so amazing The fact that you would be so supportive Of one of your friends, we see that you guys are wearing purple And we love you, because you guys are gonna Photoshop a photo Just for us to say hi And you're gonna say it just for me All you love All you love All you love All you love Bieber!\n","You Did you forget to jump you alright, buddy did you forget to jump?

Thomas Gaits The second stage of the awakening is anger. When you start to see that you are fooled you react violently for being taken for a fool and you want to lash out. This action is ineffectual in bringing about positive change for the freedom movement. In my experience those that propose violence are probably working for the government just trying to find some sucker to frame. Anger is a very natural reaction and is one that you must go through rather than suppress. Finding out how the world really works is akin to finding out your significant other has been cheating on you. You may have remained faithful to what this country was about while atrocities were committed behind your back. Anger is just covering up the fact that you are really hurt for being taken advantage of. This stage is often the shortest but it is also the one with the most energy is expended. In my anger stage I redirected my anger to fuel an intense amount of research into making sure that I was never fooled again. It eventually led to the creation of this project.\n","Do you know how to get to Harrison High School? Yeah I dont wanna get in trouble with the cops. Hamilton what? Alright.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake. But in fact she is sleepwalking. She has roused gone into her kitchen and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a  poll of over  people in Britain found that  in every  experience some form of night violence. What were doing here is really defining a third area of being. Were saying theres sleep theres waking and theres something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake-looking behavior thats not fully awake. Oh oh wait wait wait. No no no no. Dont do that.\n","The News  crime fighters helped police with manhunts by airing mugshots on our news cast. For this story we hit the road with a group of state agents who helped get the bad guys off our streets. Hands in the air! Hands in the air straight up! This is the type of operation officers trained for a police hot stop on a van in Bonita. Come on out of the car and keep those hands up! One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later... The plan for this case is that were going to go out and were going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybodys name is listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. Cultivation of marijuana DUI threat and terror crime to terrorize DV position of explosive device and drug related offenses. First stop on this day a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. Were just waiting for us  to come out in any vehicle. The News  Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. Weve got him for burglary and a robbery but we dont know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Steger a parole agent with  years experience. Every once in awhile youll find somebody whose brain is absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly a friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents follow the driver tracking him to another home. Car took off East. A short time later the driver takes off at a high speed. Since hes not wanted for a crime the agents let him go. The targets name is Charles Armstrong. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. Theyre looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Encanto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the residents permission but no luck the sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well they found the brown van in Bonita so now theyre calling for our assistance. Agents hook up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspects van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off at the pass. Alright theyre moving in now. The agents move in working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspects and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. As far as the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from that van and the clearing of the van it couldnt have gotten any better than that. Bottom line nobody got hurt. For agent Stager thats a job well done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. Theyre the best. Were just the best. Five parole agents make up the fugitive apprehension team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

Some kind of virus maybe... and the windows are shut. One day you wake up and the world has changed. Whatever it is its quite fast. Whole cities have gone to run... and returned to their own yards overnight. Those who fell became like them... and added to their numbers. The government tried to stop it. They failed... but they ended up like they came unstuck. Those that underwater did their best to survive... but they had to learn a few things. If theres just one legitimate way to get away from the threat... the workers cant be killed... or destroy their body... or even just destroy their water... they dont get any beds. The problem is how often they travel in packs like herds of hungry animals. Sometimes dozens sometimes more. Theres no room for that. The epidemic has reached the West Coast. The walkers have arrived. The world has changed. It belongs to the dead now. Lets make our move right now. Alright guys well as I mentioned the epidemic has come out here to the West Coast.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake but in fact she is sleepwalking. She has roused gone into her kitchen and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a  poll of over  people in Britain found that  in every  experienced some form of night violence. What were doing here is really defining a third area of being. Were saying theres sleep theres waking and theres something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake looking behavior but its not fully awake.

For this story we hit the road with a group of state agents who help get the bad guys off our streets. ...straight up! This is the type of operation officers train for. A police hot stop on a van in Bonita. One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later. The plan for this case is that we are going to go out and we are going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybodys names listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. ...crime to terrorize DV position of explosive device and drug-related offenses. First stop on this day a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. Were just waiting for S to come out in any vehicle. The News  Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. Weve got him for burglary and a robbery but we dont know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Stager a parole agent with  years experience. Every once in a while you find somebody whos brain is just absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly the friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents followed the driver tracking him to another home. A short time later the driver takes off at a high speed. Since hes not wanted for a crime the agents let him go. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. Theyre looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Canto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the residents permission but no luck. The sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well they found the brown van in Bonita so now theyre calling for assistance. The team took up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspects van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off of the path. Alright theyre moving him now. The agents move in working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspect and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. Because of the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from the van and the clearing of the van it couldnt have gotten any better than that. Bottom line nobody got hurt. For Agent Stager thats a job well-done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. Theyre the best. Just the best. Five parole agents make up the Fugitive Apprehension Team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

But they did it in the end they managed to escape and have won their first two Slippy Slimy Eyeballs. Two to the Greens none to the Reds yet. There you go Green Team your first two eyeballs. Lovely but dont worry there are plenty of more Haunted Rooms and plenty of more nerve-racking questions so dont look now. But there appears to be a turnip at the window. Yum yum my favorite grub.

Growing up my love for sports helped me to keep my weight down. It wasnt until after high school that I really began battling obesity along with a host of medical problems. I saw several doctors who simply sent me home with depression medication and told me to go on a diet. When I married my sweet husband a few years later I packed on another  pounds putting me at almost  pounds. My lowest point came when a doctor told me that we couldnt have children because of my weight and health. No woman wants to hear that. Though I had finally been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism I used it as an excuse assuming it was my destiny to be fat. I didnt have a big event in my life that made me decide to make a change. I just looked in the mirror one day and wondered why Id been lying to myself for so long. I asked myself am I truly happy? Is my marriage thriving? What kind of role model would I be as a mother? I knew I had to make a change so I braved up and fought back. Now a  pound slider and an active runner I have never been so happy. My marriage is thriving and my energy is incredible. I am proof that it is possible to overcome what may seem like the impossible. Wow what a doll. Okay before we ask Emily to come out were going to talk with the leader of the Pack Joy Bauer she is going to tell us more about her eating habits. She is adorable and I love that her newfound passion for health has inspired friends and family to lose weight and increase their health as well. So were in the midst of the holidays I wanted to give her some sort of a holiday health So I said Emily back in the olden days when you were heavier what were your absolute favorite fattening fair? Cheesecake! A regular restaurant portion is about  plus calories. The palm is bigger than that its huge. So I made for her a healthy version. This is a cheesecake dip. Its a fraction of the calories and all I did was I mixed non-fat cream cheese with a little bit of non-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt either works. A touch of brown sugar vanilla extract and cinnamon. And then you can dip it with fruit. And of course Ill put that out on Twitter and Facebook for our viewers. Next fettuccine alfredo! What is better than that? This is a heart attack on a plate right. Over  calories. So in my version for Emily I took fat-free evaporated skim milk and I mixed it with a little light cream cheese and it gives you this creamy velvety delicious flavor for a fraction of the calories. Is there pasta in there or is there whole wheat pasta? Its whole wheat pasta. We sauteed mushrooms sundried tomatoes and some grilled chicken. And you get a hearty portion for under  calories. All right lets look at Emilys. All right Emily come join the Joy Fit Club! Oh my gosh! Im sorry! Im sorry! The weight loss took some time. How long did you finally decided that this is the time? How long did it take? It took about a year and a half to two years to lose the weight but it was probably about a year ago when I really just kicked it into high gear. And youre a runner youre saying. How did you start that? Slowly. By stepping? Was it a walking thing? Yeah I couldnt run more than three minutes to start but every day I just went out there and I kept pushing and I kept trying. She gets whistles now. And what does your husband think of this new you? Curtis youll get your chance. Curtis is back in the kitchen. Whistling. Hows your energy level changed in all the health issues you were concerned about? Amazing Ive got so much energy. Its incredible. And I just had a checkup with my doctor recently and everything was just fantastic. Wow. I was thinking about Grace. So your chances to be a mother some day are much increased. Yes. Oh thats such a great Any advice for people at home who are kind of at the before stage where you were? Any advice for them? Dont rush it.

Our private and semi private suites and rooms assure the most comfortable accommodations and our secluded grounds guarantee the most confidential treatment available. Each individuals treatment is personally designed by our team of medical and addiction specialists to enable the best chance at a full lasting recovery. Because addiction is personal and unique to each person they need to receive unique treatment as well. Our founder Lawrence Adler has been personally touched by addiction and substance abuse issues. After watching people close to him go through numerous treatment programs that were ineffective he started researching all other options available. What he found is that most treatment programs are strongly grounded in the single treatment philosophy. Because of these shortcomings he started working with some of the best addiction and treatment specialists to design a different type of treatment option. Thus Serenity Acres was born. Serenity Acres treatment options and plans are as different as each of the patients we treat. Incorporating both Eastern and Western medicine along with proven therapies we also follow and encourage the -step treatment plan to complement all other modalities of treatment And because addiction is often caused by an underlying emotional or mental issue we treat not only the addiction but the underlying causes which creates a new way for our patients to see life and their role in the world. Serenity Acres offers many recreational activities including a swimming pool ping pong billiards shuffleboard horseshoes and basketball. Patients also go on recreational outings like bowling the movies museums and the zoo just to name a few. Our belief is that a structured yet customizable program is the best way for our patients to begin a lasting recovery. Patients are encouraged to participate in the activities and therapies that will most help them recover. Because recovery is a journey that affects the whole family we also offer well-rounded family therapy and education sessions. We believe that the more support and understanding a patient has the greater their chances for success at recovery. Recovery information often leaves the addict and their loved ones in a broken or fractured state. Our goal is to help both the patient and their families to become whole again. Our program includes the following treatment methods. Individual therapy five times per week group therapy daily holistic therapies sauna therapy -step programs -day -day -day options for treatment or a custom schedule depending on the individual. Aftercare is thorough with a detailed plan and customized to each patient.

Well I obviously have experienced my own deaths. And I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think you know I want to do a workshop and I developed this one. Using the traditional ofrenda altarp making of Mexico. And creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother. Shes been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom and the weed the staff of life. Its very easy for us as children to pull out crayons markers and pens and just start marking up the walls. And we really dont have a sense of judging ourselves in those moments. Its natural.

It can take months even years to come to grips with the loss and in some cases the trauma is so severe that special help is needed. New Jersey Resident Stephanie Moldberg is sharing her very personal story to help others. My son Eric loves sports. He was a funny little boy. He had a lot of friends. He was really kind and sensitive and he was a happy child. Eric had a wonderful relationship with his sister. They were just  months apart and they spend a lot of time together. And Lauren idolized Eric. So whatever Eric did she wanted to do. We initially found out that Eric was sick a few weeks after he got home from sleep away camp. He was away for seven weeks and he came home. And when he got home he was complaining about pain in his hip. But then a couple of weeks later it started to become more and more painful. We took him to the doctor. It was a tumor. It was stage four metastasized Ewing sarcoma bone cancer. And they had metastasized to his bone marrow and we had a long road ahead of us. And I just couldnt believe that the diagnosis of cancer. I mean kids just dont get cancer. So I sort of just had to move into a different gear. And theres so many doctors that we had to speak to. I was Erics advocate  hours a day seven days a week. My husband and my daughter didnt believe that Eric was going to die. For me it was different. I thought that he was going to die when we got the diagnosis. And then the last day he really didnt speak at all. And Erics laying down. Its about  oclock at night and I get into bed. And Im looking at him like I always did and I spend a lot of time just staring at him. And then I heard this really deep breath. It was almost like he was just trying to keep on breathing. But actually it was just saying I cant do this anymore. And that was Erics last breath. No there was a lot of planning after Eric died and funeral was just two days later and then we sat. And there are a lot of people around. But shortly after that when everybody sort of leaves and my daughter went back to school my husband went back to work. I was home by myself a lot and I didnt know what to do. And everything was foreign to me because for pretty much  months I didnt do very much but take care of Eric. And I didnt know how to sort of readjust to life and to reengage in life again. And my days were very very long. And there was no structure to them. And what happens with people that have a difficult time adjusting after their loss is that they feel like they get stuck in time. That their grief is not progressing. And my grief wasnt progressing. Stephanie was suffering from a condition called complicated grief. Its an intense form of grief that needs specialized treatment. And with us this morning is Stephanie Maldburg and Dr. Catherine Sherr founder of the Complicated Grief Program at Columbia University. First of all thank you so much for sharing your very personal story with us. Lets talk about how you even were diagnosed because it was a long road to even get there. It took me four years to get diagnosed. Actually it was my daughter she had been seeing a doctor who had seen Dr. Sherr lecture at Columbia University. And Laurens doctor recognized that I had many of the symptoms that Dr. Sherr had been describing in complicated grief. And she asked Lauren if I could. She can call contact me and she did. And then the following week I had an appointment and I met Dr. Sherr. Dr. Sherr lets talk about the difference between complicated grief and the grief that many of us are familiar with. Yeah. So I think its useful to think about loss losing a loved one as being a little bit like getting a serious physical wound. In that theres a natural healing process that occurs and its painful but the pain diminishes as the healing goes on. And sometimes we know a wound can get complicated. Right? It can be there can be an infection or trouble with the vascular supply or something like that and when that happens you have to treat the complication to let the wound heal. And the same thing can actually happen with grief. It can get complicated so that it doesnt do that natural healing. And Stephanie was talking about some of the symptoms that and we put those up on the screen. There are so many different symptoms. Stephanie lets talk about how the treatment has helped you. Its a  week program? Yes. It was very time limited and very structured. And I had been in therapy before but I was avoiding talking about the most difficult things. And that was my loss. And when I met Dr. Cher there was a very she was very guided and she kept me on track. And I had I did imaginal revisiting exercises and conversations. Those were really two very helpful tools for me. It helped me progress. And I was so fearful that I was going to forget Eric and the memories that I had of him. And doctor the person who is going through complicated grief Im guessing that person very often does not recognize that in themselves. What advice do you have for people around them that may see it? Well you know people gather around people after they lose someone close. They just do that naturally and they provide a lot of support and emotional and practical support and they dont expect it to be over right away. But you know when it starts to people notice when someone else months and months have gone by and someone is still experiencing intense intense emotions and its disrupting their lives. And their natural inclination at that point is to say you know honey I know this was hard but you know its time to move on and put this behind you. But we cant put a loss behind us. We have to learn to live with it. And so you know really what other people need to realize is that when a person isnt doing that its not because they dont want to. Its because theres something really stopping them. And thats you know thats when they kind of need help rather than just pushing you know? Well Dr. Shear thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie you were saying that Dr. Shear really saved your life. Thank you Mill. I thought so. Thank you.

So I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And I mean we dont really think about it but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance. Oh my god is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. It just doesnt make sense. No it does. No its not over. I have four years of college to go through. It will be exactly the same. No it will be completely different. Oh my god is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. Like I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean school is a part of the real world but Im assuming that you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case yeah. No. Come fall semester Im just going to show up at any class that I want to. What are they going to do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? Its not a bad thing. Im not leaving my room until Im  and nursing a child. This sucks. I have to get a real job now! If you want money. I dont need money or material things all I need is friends and a family. Dont you think youre being a little unrealistic? Dont you think youre being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I dont like new things! I dont do new things! Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay its okay. I mean Ill have all the same friends that I do now. I mean well stay in touch no matter what. You wont. Its okay Ill just go to grad school. I mean its not that expensive. You could do that I mean if you dont think youre ready for serious employment go back to school learn more. Perfect I just wont turn . And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god everyones gonna be so far away and Im gonna be alone! Im gonna have to talk to people! Yeah thats kind of something we humans do. I dont have money how am I supposed to do this?! Student loans? Okay maybe Ill just hope for a big student loan and Ill spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought. Wow I forgot about those student loans. I cant afford graduate school I have to get a job. I hate milkshakes! Ahahaha. Yeah about that youll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. Im too old to get away with stuff now. Life goes on. I guess Ill just be popular in college. I guess it is over. Im too old to freeload. Life goes on. But I am still really pissed that there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen damn it! And yes I said penis and vagina. Theyre not bad words theyre body parts. It made me think that just because I graduated college I should put my hair up. Over it.\n","Elsword Animation Come on wait up. Who are you? Youre... Roxas. How can you be here? Am i dreaming?

And my grief wasnt progressing. Stephanie was suffering from a condition called Complicated Grief. Its an intense form of grief that needs specialized treatment and with us this morning is Stephanie Moldburg and Dr. Catherine Shear founder of the Complicated Gruf Program at Columbia University. First of all thank you so much for sharing your very personal story with us. Just talk about how you even were diagnosed because it was a long road to even get there. Right it took me four years to get diagnosed. Actually it was my daughter she had been seeing a doctor who had seen Dr. Shear lecture at Columbia University and Laurens doctor recognized that I had many of the symptoms that Dr. Shear had been describing Complicated Grief. She asked Lauren if I could she can contact me and she did and then the following week I had an appointment and I met Dr. Shear. Dr. Shear lets talk about the difference between Complicated Grief and the grief many of us are familiar with. So I think its useful to think about loss losing a loved one as being little bit like getting a serious physical wound in that theres a natural healing process that occurs and is painful but the pain diminishes as the healing goes on. And sometimes we know a wound can get complicated right? There can be an infection or trouble with the vascular supply or something like that. And when that happens you have to treat the complication to let the wound heal. And the same thing can actually happen with grief. It can get complicated so that it doesnt do that natural healing. And Stephanie was talking about some of the symptoms that and we put those up on the There are so many different symptoms. Stephanie lets talk about how the treatment has helped you. Its a -week program. Yes. It was very time-limited and very structured. And I had been in therapy before but I was avoiding talking about the most difficult things and that was my loss. And when I met Dr. Scheer there was a very she was very guided. And she kept me on track. And I had I did imaginal revisiting exercises and conversations. And those were really two very helpful tools for me. It helped me progress. And I was so fearful that I was going to forget Eric and the memories that I had of him. And Dr. Scheer the person whos going through complicated grief Im guessing that person very often does not recognize it in themselves. What advice do you have for people around them that may see it? Well you know people gather around people after they lose someone close. They just do that naturally and they provide a lot of support you know emotional and practical support. And they dont expect it to be over right away but you know when it starts to When people notice when someone else is Its you know months and months have gone by and someone is still experiencing intense intense emotions and its disrupting their lives. And their natural inclination at that point is to say you know honey I know this was hard but you know its time to move on and put this behind you. But we cant put a loss behind us. We have to learn to live with it. And so you know really what we have What other people need to realize is that when a person isnt doing that its not because they dont want to. Its because theres something really stopping them. And thats you know thats when they kind of need help rather than just pushing you know. Well Dr. Scheer thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie you were saying that Dr. Scheer really saved your life. Thank you. My life better. Thank you.

So I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And I mean we dont really think about it but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance... Oh my God is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. It just doesnt make sense. No no its not over. I have  years of college to go through. Itll be exactly the same. No itll be completely different. Oh my God is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. Like I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean school is a part of the real world. But Im assuming you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case yeah. No come fall semester Im just gonna show up at any class that I want to. What are they gonna do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? Its not a bad thing. Im not leaving my room until Im  and nursing a child! This sucks! I have to get a real job now? If you want money. I dont need money or material things. All you need is friends and family! Dont you think youre being a little unrealistic? Dont you think youre being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I dont like new things. I dont do new things. Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay its okay. I mean Ill have all the same friends that I do now. I mean well stay in touch no matter what. You wont. Its okay. Ill just go to grad school. I mean its not that expensive. You could do that. I mean if you dont think youre ready for serious employment go back to school. Learn more. Perfect. I just want to turn . And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god everyone is going to be so far away and Im going to be alone. Im going to have to talk to people. Yeah thats kind of something we humans do. I dont have money. How am I supposed to do this? Student loans. Okay maybe Ill just hope for a big student loan and Ill spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought! Wow I forgot about those student loans! I cant afford graduate school! I have to get a job! I hate milkshakes! Yeah about that. Youll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. Im too old to get away with stuff now! Life goes on... Guess Ill just be popular in college. I guess it is over. Im too old to freeload. Life goes on... But Im still really pissed there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen damn it! And yes I said penis and vagina. Theyre not bad words. Theyre body parts. -  years later... And what made me think that just because I graduated college I should put my hair up? No. Over it.\n","Come on wait up. Who are you? Youre...Roxas!? How can you be here? Am I dreaming? Come on say something! This could have been the other way around. Huh? But it really has to be you. What do you mean? There are so many hearts that are connected to yours. Youre me so you can feel what I felt. No! Roxas youre you. Were not the same. I wanted to tell you that. That you deserve as much as I do to be your own person. Sora see? Thats why it has to be you. Not again. Did they cause all this pain? What do you want me to see!? Sora... Dont chase the dreams. Theyll lead you nowhere. Just believe in the gifts that youll never be able to wake up from.\n","you.\n","Shades of Noir Grief means... every emotion I think. I felt really sad and didnt want to do anything or talk again. I figured I had to talk. Its been hard to sleep because I usually sleep sometimes with my dad. I feel like my mom is with me because shes an angel. What Id like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes. And sometimes I dream about him. While my brother was riding a bike he was hit by a texting driver. The advice I would give to kids who have lost a loved one is talking to people doesnt hurt and it actually really helps. What I want people to know is its really hard but youll get through it. I know you can. The advice I would give is dont keep it in. You need to talk to someone because it will just keep building in. It feels like hes everywhere I go. Even if hes gone I just love him so.\n","Who are you? William Jones. Good morning Adam. I wont hurt you. Please. But baby you look fabulous. I knew you. Im so sorry. Goodbye. You\n","Come on Protect.

There is a giant gorilla with a tiny tiny tiny helpless kitten and being gentle and loving towards that kitten. Coco rhymed a name for her new kitten. She called him all ball because to her the cat looked like a little ball. Coco adored all ball and they spent countless hours playing together. And yet it was by loving the little tailless kitten that Coco learned one of lifes hardest lessons. One evening all ball was tragically killed on a nearby logging road. Coco was heartbroken. All ball hit by a car... I went in right away. I said Coco somethings happened to your kitty and he wont be here anymore. You know hes... hes... the cat has died. Penny stayed with Coco to comfort her. And later privately Coco expressed her grief.\n","Choir singing\n","poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores\n","Ive got the joy joy joy joy Down in my heart Down in my heart And Im so happy so happy so very happy And Im so happy so happy so very happy For being And I can understand And I can pretend That this will be alright in the end So Ill try my best\n","Taeb Tataab Taeb Tataab\n","Carter!

My father didnt tell us anything. He had voted for poison. Whoever has to die they dont come from Jihad. Both the sons died because of poison. Some die from hunger Some die from cough. We are only yearning for peace. My wife passed away after comitting suicide by poison. I am left with nothing. People tried to keep the kids away from me. They told me I would be a widow then. My life depends on God now. God knows I would die one day. I committed suicide but I cant lose my family. And new books have been written the people of a wailing earth The wailing is the country of Punjab The wailing is the country of Punjab Out of the ecstasy of those tears my sister writes my name Today hundreds and thousands of daughters are weeping and they call me the heir of Glory Today the eyes are tears of Glory of that who I once was\n","I think we live in a society here where people dont really want to accept death. And I try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. Im working on an offering for my cousin who passed away five months ago. But he was an avid runner he was a cook so this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors opening up doors into your subconscious. To me using the symbols and using the colors and using the things that I know were close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. Its nothing to fear. Well I obviously have experienced my own deaths and I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think you know I want to do a workshop and I developed this one using the traditional ofrenda altar making of Mexico and creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother. Shes been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom and the wheat the staff of life. Its very easy for us as children to pull out crayons markers and pens and just start marking up the walls. And we really dont have a sense of judging ourselves in these moments. Its natural. And I enjoy using art therapy with most of my participants because I feel its a wonderful expression and vehicle for them to process their emotions.\n","Good afternoon and welcome to our talk tonight.\n","Unnamed \n","Oh his phone hangs between your breaths I hope you havent pulled it yet And if this little finger doesnt have the strength Then Im scared that this birds backbone breaks Its only hope that springs eternal And thats the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is never running dry I wear a ring of your lipstick Around the knuckle of my fourth digit It reminds me what our bodies sewed It will go through until we are betrothed Its only hope that springs eternal And thats the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Space between your navel In your waistband was the ice Where two fingers pirouette But now these handnails they just slice Its on the hardwood that springs eternal And thats the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Never running dry Your tongue thats high your lips the shore I am the jets Im overboard Goodbye courage I christen all the ships that sail Im your little kiss your saliva trail Goodbye courage hell of sadness again Farewell memories Of new highs and lows Goodbye courage hell of sadness Hope that springs eternal But thats the reason why This dripping from my broken eye Is never running dry Hope that springs eternal But thats the reason why My broken heart is never running dry I let those forefingers got me Leave me only with my thunder Constantly is pointing down me Emperor besties not friends Its only hope that springs eternal But thats the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is Never running dry Never running dry\n","Puppy Surprise is having puppies!

How fortuitous he says for a species to find in its own ability to contemplate to marvel at its own existence has been evolutionarily advantageous. In other words it has been biologically selected for because it informs our life with a sense of cosmic significance that makes us work harder to persist and to survive. In other words awe has helped us survive. And you know a recent study out of Stanford on the subject of awe kind of validates this idea. They have found that regular incidences of awe leave residual benefits upon the individual that persists such as increased feelings of empathy and compassion towards others increased feelings of altruism and increased feelings of general well-being. In this study they defined awe as an experience of such perceptual expansion. Such perceptual vastness that you literally have to reconfigure upgrade your mental schemata just to accommodate just to take in the scale of the experience. This is amazing. Weve all felt this before the first time weve stared upon the Grand Canyon or succumbed to the immersive power of an IMAX film but perhaps the most exquisite account of the experience of awe was articulated by the brilliant Ross Anderson when writing about the Hubble Space Telescope. Pay attention he says that the Hubble has given us nothing less than an ontological awakening a forceful reckoning with what is allowing us to contemplate space and time on a scale just shy of infinite. Wild! He says gazing upon the famous Deep Field photograph literally allows us to mainline the whole of time through the optic nerve to fit something so impossibly large to something so impossibly small. Simple. Incredible. He says through the sheer aesthetic force of its discoveries the Hubble distills the impossibly complex abstractions of astrophysics into these singular expressions of color and light vindicating Keiths famous couplet beauty is truth. Truth. Beauty.\n","USGS position target is leaving the building. Over. Well have eyes on target in one second. Eyes on target now. Target wearing violet top black skirt black satchel.

What is the difference? Lets just stay on taxes for a moment. Well but virtually everything you just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. This is about getting jobs for the American people. Jim let me just come back on that on that point which is the small businesses were talking about. Excuse me just so everybody understands were way over our first  minutes. Fun isnt it? Its okay its great. Thats all no problem. Jim the President began this segment so I think I get the last word. Youre going to get the first word in the next segment. Well but he gets this first word of that segment. Way over the two minutes. Sorry. Putting it forward before Congress right now  trillion plan. But youve been president four years youve been president four years make one more point. Let me answer the taxes thing for a moment. Okay. Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. Hes ruled out revenue? Absolutely. Look Medicaid schools oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. But its real but but the right the right approach is running May... And you dont support that? I dont. Yeah again thats for future I understand. Not for current retirees. Jim if I can just respond very quickly not just in Medicare and Medicaid. Talk about that. But overall. And so... Thats thats a big topic... I want to get to it but all I want to do quick very quickly before we leave the economy. Lets get back to Medicare. The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost but my experience my experience is that private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. Can we can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice a clear choice between you on Medicare? All right. Regulation can become excessive... Is it excessive now do you think? Well in some places yes other places no. It can become out of date. Leverage limits for institutions... Heres a specific... Let me mention the other lets talk here the big one... Lets not... But thats not what I believe... Thats just not the facts. Now the last point Id make before... Two minutes is up sir. No I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me... Leaving millions of people out in the cold... Your five seconds went away a long time ago... Well I did with my first statement and Ill go on... Please allow me... These are tough problems and weve got to make choices and the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country. Were gonna move to... Which is which is my experience... Theyre setting up their training programs... Do you agree Governor? Let me just finish the point... I suspect it will be very well in my state by the way... Yeah... Were running out of time... Any chances to respond to that... Mr. President youre entitled for all of our kids... All right gentlemen look... Excuse me one second... Excuse me sir...

This teacher has a particular student named Chelsea. Chelsea loves Justin Bieber. Tried to buy tickets they were sold out. Parents tried to buy tickets they were sold out. The teacher even wanted to try and buy tickets for Chelsea too. Couldnt get a hold of any so now Chelseas grade-eight class have been trying to win her tickets from us every single morning and every single afternoon so weve decided to come here and surprise Chelsea and tell her that shes going to Justin Bieber. We have a pair of tickets for her. Now this is super stealth mode we couldnt come in the Virgin vehicle because everybody would see so were driving my old blazer  blazer.. sweet ride.. no one will suspect a thing although theres four of us in here and the windows are fogging up but so were gonna go to the office get the teacher and then Jamie whos recording right now is gonna go into the class pretend that hes helping record some huge announcement when we bust in yo with Bieber tickets. Yeah Chelsea were coming for you. Dont stop believing. So heres the notorious miss Greenberg who wrote the email telling us about the lovely Chelsea. So heres the background in about what is it  minutes or so were gonna call it a meeting of sorts where were gonna have about  people in a room you didnt know how to lie to your students? Right. So what did you tell them? I told them that there was a possibility of one of their teachers leaving next week and I managed to put on some fake tears for them so they think that that person is me so they are all prepared for the absolute worst. Thats good thats good. That is a horrible story. A horrible lie but good. So tell us a little bit about Chelsea and why you wanted to make sure she got Justin Bieber tickets? Chelsea is the best kid ever she is in French shes what we call the little chouchou she does anything to make anybody happy she is a psycho Justin Bieber fan like its ridiculous you know like well be writing math tests and there will be a question that has nothing to do with Justin Bieber and she will find a way to incorporate him into her answer. Shes just shes a really lovely kid she goes above and beyond with everything she does and shes just so deserving of this and the kids have been trying so hard the whole class has been trying so hard to help her win these tickets. And so lets say that this is grade eight yeah these are  going on  year olds so I think thats really amazing youre right thats so rare you have like a whole class of kids that are pulling together to send somebody to go Theyre all actually wearing purple today because they wanted to take a picture and photoshop Justin Bieber into it and send it to the radio station at lunch as a whole class wearing purple to try and You are kidding? theres  kids wearing purple right now oh my gosh yeah Im so excited I could get sick do you know what I mean theres like so many nerves here Ive been feeling like that since last night I havent slept all night because Im Ive just been so excited for this kid there is gonna be one less lonely girl Chelseas going to Justin Bieber thank you very much okay lets go do this Good Morning Id like to introduce Jamie Morning hi guys We have something to share with you Miss Greenberg indicated that this meeting was very important to something so Where is Chelsea? Chelsea Where is Chelesea AHHH Chelsea hi Chrissy this is LTI So we are so You guys We are so impressed We think you guys are the best You guys are so amazing The fact that you would be so supportive Of one of your friends we see that you guys are wearing purple And we love you because you guys are gonna Photoshop a photo Just for us to say hi And youre gonna say it just for me All you love All you love All you love All you love Bieber!\n","You Did you forget to jump you alright buddy did you forget to jump?

Thomas Gaits The second stage of the awakening is anger. When you start to see that you are fooled, you react violently for being taken for a fool and you want to lash out. This action is ineffectual in bringing about positive change for the freedom movement. In my experience, those that propose violence are probably working for the government just trying to find some sucker to frame. Anger is a very natural reaction and is one that you must go through rather than suppress. Finding out how the world really works is akin to finding out your significant other has been cheating on you. You may have remained faithful to what this country was about while atrocities were committed behind your back. Anger is just covering up the fact that you are really hurt for being taken advantage of. This stage is often the shortest, but it is also the one with the most energy is expended. In my anger stage, I redirected my anger to fuel an intense amount of research into making sure that I was never fooled again. It eventually led to the creation of this project.\n","Do you know how to get to Harrison High School? Yeah I don't wanna get in trouble with the cops. Hamilton what? Alright.

Let's just say, I loathe it all. Every little trait, however small, makes my very flesh begin to crawl. With simple uttered loathing there's a strange exhilaration. In such total detestation, it's so pure it's so strong. Though I do admit it came on fast. Still I do believe that it can last. And I will be loathing, loathing you my whole life long. Oh, Elfie. Well, these things are sent to dry us. Loathing feelings so sudden and new. I've got the moment I lay eyes on you. I've got my voice rushing, my head is railing. I love it all. Oh what is it failing? Every trait however small. Does it have a name? Let's begin to crawl. Oh loathing there's a strange exhilaration. In such total defestation. It's so pure and so strong. How I do admit it came one fast. Still I do believe that it can last. And I will be loathing forever loathing.

You know, I just watched six episodes of Doctor Who in one day. Um, last time I checked it was one. pfft ... It's 2.45 right now. Right now there's two girls out on my window, um, out there, and they're screaming, LEMONADE? 50 cents! And it's unbelievably annoying me to the part where I just blow my head off.

Damn, bastard. This sucks. Hey, Narco. What's the matter, weird? I'm just exhausted. Finally got time off. How many missions is that now? There's like 8 in a row. I mean, I like working but, that's too many. And then I found out I didn't even need to be on one of them. But you went along anyway, didn't ya? Yeah, that's extra money, I hope. So Nadi's gonna kill you. She has to pay you now. And you know what she's like with money. Eh, yeah, I'll just gamble it back for her. She'll be fine. Well at least you can go out on missions. Like still bothering ya? Yeah. Bastard Ninja. And where was he from again?! What? Where was he from? Um, Land of Lightning. You like? Oh. Yeah, Land of Lightning, I thought they were normal. Nah, I dunno about those guys. I dunno. So Nadi's done what she's can for now. I dunno when I'm gonna be allowed another mission again. So I'm bored out of my mind. And Zaka keeps coming around and bothering me thinking I need company. Yeah. So. Nothing I can do. I'm gonna say this- This feel's a little weird, I mean. What have you done to him? Yeah, um. Don't waste your breath. Or your energy. He sealed it. That guy. The one who did my knee in? Yeah. He used some kind of jutsu and locked my katana. He didn't realize though, I had another one. And a scroll so. This one is fine. Where did actually put the seal on it? I don't know. That's the problem. Lemme have a look at it. I think it's on the inside of the sheath. I'll get Kakashi to look at it later. You might be able to bring it out with the resurgence wand but. I mean sometimes you can just. I mean if you just- If it's on the top then it's fine but if it's put down here then it might break the blade, there might be a trick in the seal that'll break the blade. I know that's what I'm worried about because sometimes you can just pull them but OH DO THAT! Exactly. There might be a bomb in it as well. Oh well. That's why you need the resurgence wand. If you don't get a resurgence on it to find out what kind of seal it is, then you're screwed. I like this katana. Ever since my actual uchiha one was destroyed and I got these. I actually kinda like these. This one's a little bit much better balanced. Not that it matters because I'm not going to get to use them any time soon because I'm banned from missions and I've been told not to train too much. I've been told not to train at all, apparently I've done too much, I don't know why. Not saying they do apparently, I'm just taking up too much time or something, I don't know. I'm bored! I'm bored out my brain! You're not the only one, trust me. So why are you here then? I thought maybe you'd know of something to do. Can't go anywhere, not like there's anything exciting in the village anyway. Not unless you want soccer to drag you to the festival. No, I think she's trying to bring the festival to me because... I refused to wear crutches but I'm... It's kind of hard to walk at the moment, as much as I hate to admit that. So we're not racing or anything, because you would win and that wouldn't be fair. Could probably go find something to do though. There's got to be something. I mean, how big is your estate? It's mostly empty. Exactly! There's meant to be something, somewhere. Err... maybe we should just... I don't know... go watch a movie or something... I don't know... Like what? I don't know, Naruto. I'm just... I'm bored out of my mind, and I'm sore and pissed off. OK, let's go find something to do... Come on! Why are you using your sword as a crutch? Maybe... It works. This is good. I'm not dying, this is good. Can I stand on this? You can stand on that one, yeah. Uh, ooooh this is a bad idea. There's a long way down. What if we trip and fall, or the beams fall out? Give me a whistling hour, Turner. Come on, get out of my way. aggressively moaning Plop! The stump is moving! What if there were birds nesting up here? There aren't any birds. Are you sure? What about bats? We had bats a while ago, but- the bat was taken care of. I can hear wind howling. Of course you can, we are on a roof. Isn't- I would like to get out of the roof, before the roof collapses. The roof's not gonna collapse. I WAS NOT MADE FOR HIGH PLACES! Alright, down ya go. Nooo, I can't go down just yet because- we've got to finish what we were doing up here and then I can go down! Blech! Woah! I'm fine. This book is really dumb. Jeez, how many books have you got up here? Uh, a lot. I like to read. This is a crime! Action, attraction! Oh wow, I haven't played that game in years. I used to love that one as a kid. Take it! I can't believe we're up in my attic looking for board games. Well, we're bored and when you're bored, you play board games. Is that why they're called board games? No. No. It's because they're actually not a board. Stupid question, ignore me. I'll go down and you can hand me those board games, OK, Norto? OK. Why do we have to put the ladder like this? You're an idiot. Cause I can't jump down like you can. It's that easy! What, what did you do? Are you OK down there? I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. And he calls ME an idiot? Hey, I've heard that. Ow. Hey, which idiot jumped down on his broken knee. Ow now my foot hurts. Ow. It actually does. This is all your fault Dobie. Why's it my fault? Because you suggested going up to the attic in the first place. Ow. Aw shut up Marzo. When you come down here, I'm gonna beat you to a pulp. You mean if he can stand up. Yeah. Ow. Ow. Hurry up Dobie, I can't stand up. You're a moron. You're an actual moron. Yeah well that comes like, hand in hand with being your best friend. You cheeky... What possesses you to jump down on a broken knee? I forgot about it. How do you forget a broken knee!? I don't. Shut up Marzo! This sucks. You are a fucking idiot, you know that. Shut up Marzo. Here, I brought you books. You like books, you read books, you moron. I've already read all of these. So read it again! I don't want to read right now. But you read one! Fine. I will read this one. Read a book? I didn't know you could read. Oh this sucks. It was your own fault for jumping out of the roof on a broken knee. What's that word mean? What word? Sailed. Oh right. As in a boat. Right, OK. What does that word mean? Fetch. As in you go to fetch something? Oh Marta you're an idiot. How did you say that? Oh my god! Let's do something else. What can we do with your broken leg? Well I got the board games down so maybe we could play one of them. Go get them! Fine! OK so, what do you do with this stupid thing? Do you.. I've never played this before, you'll have to tell me how to play this. It's dead easy Naruto, you have these weird magnetic marble things and you place them on... I want the blue ones. I want the orange ones! No! You can either get orange or blue and I say orange! I want the orange! I want the red. Fine, I'm having the white ones, and the yellow ones. I don't want the green ones! I want the green ones! Fine I'll have the green ones. Great! You've got two of my family colours. But you've got one of mine! Which one? The yellow! Yellow is hardly in your family. It is! It's just the colour of your hair, red and white Uchiha fan. F Roll. There! Awesome. Right. So you just place a marble... Do we have to put this on the Easy Setting? Do you want to put it on the Hard Setting? If it's for children! Yes, but you're playing. I take offence to that. You're supposed to. Right so I just stick a marble on? Yes. There. Any colour? Yeah. You're such a hopeless loser. So what if I do those? They're out, you're losing already. Oh fuck. Naruto! Why did I not get it in this game? They're magnets, moron. What's the point of it?! Oh my god, you really are hopeless. Ow, what was that for?! Don't laugh at me, I've never played this before! You've gotta put them all on the points without getting them all stuck together. You could've told me that! You never gave me the chance. I thought you would last more than one shot before you set them off. So here that's yours and that's yours so they're all out so you're losers. This is played like not even- Let's just play! Just play! Sorry, I spapped there. Oh, blood! Ha! Oh, my turn, right? Okay. Ha ha! Damn it! I'm still doing better than you are. You're going to still set one off any second now. Ohh! You! You cripple! You're not a cripple! You're just stupid! Get off of me already! Get off! I'll throw this at your knee! Ow! I don't think we should play this anymore.

There might be a trick in the seal that would break the blade if you pull it out. I know, that's what I'm worried about, because sometimes you can just pull them. Don't do that! Exactly. There might be a bomb in it as well. Oh well. That's why you need the resurgence one, if you don't get a resurgence one to find out what kind of seal it is then you're screwed. I like this katana. So, ever since my actual uchiha one was destroyed and I got these two I actually kinda like these. This one is a little bit much better balanced, but not because it matters because I'm not going to get to use them any time soon, because I'm banned from missions and I've been told not to train too much. I've been told not to train at all because apparently I've done too much, I don't know why. That's just a walk. Not unless you want Saka to drag you to the festival. No, I think she tried to bring the festival to me because I refused to wear crutches but it's kinda hard to walk at the moment. As much as I hate to admit that. So we're not racing or anything, cause he would win and that wouldn't be fair. We could probably go find something to do though. There's got to be something, I mean how big is your estate? It's mostly empty. Exactly! There's got to be something somewhere. Maybe we should just, I don't know, go watch a movie or something, I don't know. Like what? I don't know Naruto, I'm just, I'm bored out of my mind and I'm sore and pissed off. OK, let's go find something to do, come on! Are you using your sword as a crutch, maybe? It works!

How did you say that one? Oh, my god. Let's do something else. Well, what can we do with your broken leg? Well, I got the board games down, so I don't know, maybe we can play one of them.

Right, okay, we'll do the blue ones. Okay, I want the red. Fine, I'm having the white ones and the yellow ones. I don't want the green ones. Well I don't care, you're getting the green ones. Fine, I'll have the green ones. Great. You've got two of my family cellars. Well you've got one of mine! Which one? Yellow! Yellow was hardly one of your family cellars. It is! It's just the color of your hair! Red, and white, you chi-ha fan. There. Awesome, right. So, you just place the marble... Do we have to put this on the easy setting? Do you want to put it on the hard setting, or to... Well, if it's for children... Yeah, but you're playing. I take offense to that. You're supposed to. Right. So you just stick a marble on? Yes. There. Any color? Yeah. You're such a hopeless loser. So what do I do with those? They're out, right. You're losing already. Clark. What? I don't get this game! They're magnets, moron. What's the point of it? Oh my god, you really are hopeless. Ow! What was that for? Don't laugh at me! I never played this before because I don't know what we're gonna be- You've gotta put them all on the points without getting them all stuck together. Well, you could have told me that! You never gave me the chance, I thought you would last more than one shot before you set them off. So... Here, that's yours and that's yours, so they're all out, so you're losing. This is played like, not even... Let's just play! Just play! Sorry, I stopped there. Ha. Oh, it's my turn, right? Okay. Ahhhhhhhh! Damn it. I'm still doing better than you are.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake. But in fact, she is sleepwalking. She has roused, gone into her kitchen, and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a 1997 poll of over 4,000 people in Britain found that 2 in every 100 experience some form of night violence. What we're doing here is really defining a third area of being. We're saying there's sleep, there's waking, and there's something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake-looking behavior that's not fully awake. Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. Don't do that.\n","The News 8 crime fighters helped police with manhunts by airing mugshots on our news cast. For this story we hit the road with a group of state agents who helped get the bad guys off our streets. Hands in the air! Hands in the air, straight up! This is the type of operation officers trained for, a police hot stop on a van in Bonita. Come on out of the car and keep those hands up! One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest, National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents, the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later... The plan for this case is that we're going to go out and we're going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybody's name is listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. Cultivation of marijuana, DUI, threat and terror, crime to terrorize, DV, position of explosive device, and drug related offenses. First stop on this day, a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. We're just waiting for us 1 to come out in any vehicle. The News 8 Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. We've got him for burglary and a robbery but we don't know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Steger, a parole agent with 28 years experience. Every once in awhile you'll find somebody whose brain is absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly a friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents follow the driver tracking him to another home. Car took off East. A short time later the driver takes off at a high speed. Since he's not wanted for a crime, the agents let him go. The target's name is Charles Armstrong. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. They're looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Encanto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the resident's permission but no luck, the sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well they found the brown van in Bonita so now they're calling for our assistance. Agents hook up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspect's van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off at the pass. Alright, they're moving in now. The agents move in, working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspects and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. As far as the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from that van and the clearing of the van, it couldn't have gotten any better than that. Bottom line, nobody got hurt. For agent Stager, that's a job well done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. They're the best. We're just the best. Five parole agents make up the fugitive apprehension team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

To the units that are with the three vehicles, let's make a plan, here. Let's take one of those vehicles. They're going to be straight south on this two-track, but let's make a little path where we can cut them off to the west or to the east. Bring a vehicle down that two-track and turn left, and let's get on the east side of them. Then we'll put agents on the west side of them, and then we'll go in from there. So half of you make a left, and hook them down the tree line, and then the others hold there for just a minute. Okay, you four agents, just stay right now on that tree line and follow that tree line south. Yeah, you four can go south from there. Go south down the tree line. How many are with the vehicle still? Is there more than one agent? There's going to be two agents. Do you want more with the vehicle? But we need the ones that are going to make the jump with the vehicle. They'll be closer. Okay, you guys on the east side, you three, you're almost going to be parallel with them. Go another 10 yards and stop, and then the agent's coming down the west side. This is looking real good. You agents on the east side, you three, stop where you are, 90 degrees right, and they're going to be straight in. Be ready when the jump happens. They're going to come to you if they jump, agents moving south as a team of 6, 20 yards to your left. Watch your radio. You're going to be getting close. Keep coming down. Can you jump us so I can turn my lights on? Yeah, we have a bit of radio. Go ahead, agent. OK, you guys coming south, you got bodies 10 yards into your left, and then about 10 yards forward and in. There you go, keep coming. OK, fan out right there and go straight in. Straight in left, that's where your bodies are. They're all in there. Straight in. Spread out pretty wide. They're all spread out. Yep, you got something right there to your left. Got a group, then keep pushing in, there'll be more. You got runners coming to the east side. They're actually going south. You got two runners going south now. South. Now they're going east. Just go parallel them down the two track. They're staying in the trees. But just, there you go guys, you're paralleling them. Keep running down the two track. Keep running down the two track. No, don't turn in yet. Keep going south. You guys, you two on the east side, keep running south. You're paralleling them. Keep going. Keep going south. They're 10 yards ahead of you, but they're still running south. You're parallel to them. Keep moving south. Keep moving south. You are even with them. Turn in now. Turn in now. Turn back west. They're headed... Ok unit in the vehicle, unit in the vehicle, you're almost even with them. Come up some more. They're coming right to you. Stop. Stop. Straight out your driver door.

Yeah keep going straight, agent. Keep going straight. Keep going straight. Five yards. Five yards. You should see his feet low and to your right. Low and to your right. There's another agent on top of him now. He's laying down. There you go. Right there. Do you see him in there? The agent, right across from the one with one in custody. He's at your feet. There you go. You got him. Yeah, I do have another one. I've got another one now. Okay. The two agents on the east side. You both have. Yep, one just stopped. There's two of you. Yes. You with your left arm up. You're going to be closest. Stand by just a second. Let me get him again. Come on. Let's go. There you are. Okay. Agent that had your arm up. Walk south on the two track, about five yards for me, and stop. Walk south on the two track. Keep walking south. Keep walking south. Stop. Right there. Turn right and go straight in. He's going to be prone. It's just real tough to see him, but go straight in from where you are. Agent, walking up behind the mobile unit. You have a body. Never mind. I'll get somebody else. You guys just walk straight in. You'll be on him. We've got agents walking in from the east side now. You two, if you can find a way in there. Y'all are the closest. Yeah, okay. The agent that's behind the patrol unit on the west side, stop. Yes, you. You're even with the body. You can move east. Move straight in. Okay, the agent that's coming from the east, go right a little bit. Straight in. More to your right. This agent closer to us, turn right. Now, go straight west. I know we're sticking in there. He's at the base of a tree. You two that are together, kind of veer to your right a little bit. Where the lights at? Where at? Okay, right, right, five yards, seven yards, straight in front of you. Straight in front of you, laying down with his head against a tree. Walk straight in, like, five more yards. Little to your left. Little to your left. Got one more. Okay. Okay, I think I may have one more. Stand by just a second. To the two agents on the east side, both of them have their flashlights in their right hand. If you can, move north along that tree line for me. Okay, you two agents, you're straight in now. If you can go straight in towards the original jump. It's getting back to about four o'clock. I'm just, just, probably 20 yards north of the patrol vehicles. Oh, okay, 20 yards north. Yeah, 104. Gotcha. Good line now, 10 yards. Good line, 10 yards. Okay, go a little to your left. A little to your left, more to your left. About 10 o'clock. Five, seven yards. Five yards. Keep coming. Keep coming. A little to your left. A little to your left. Three to five yards in that thick stuff right there. Right there, your eyes are on them. There may be more than one there. Yeah, there is. Use caution. Okay. Two. Got them both? Three. Crap. No, two.

Ah!\n","Right now we're gonna go on the walking dead Terra tram Welcome aboard the terra tram everyone Passengers, please make sure you drag your bodies over to the right hand side of the tram so you can get as many bodies onboard Alright guys, are you ready to go out there for the Terra tram? I don't know, that didn't sound like you were ready. Let's try that one more time. Are you guys ready?! Alright, okay guys, wave good bye! You are never going to see them again! Now, we're going to head out here on our Terra tram adventure. We just want to make sure you guys stay safe. Keep your arms and legs inside the tram unless you plan on leaving them behind. and if you're silly enough to rings your windows too, make sure to place them in the center of the roads, keeping them away from the side gains. and if you have an emergency of any kind pull that cord out of the center of the tram and I'll come back to assist you. Now enough of that, let's head down to the mini crane guys! There's a big zombie outbreak, shall I say, an epidemic? It started on the west coast and is out here now. and guys pay attention, seriously, this might save your life. Here's a little bit more information. They say it started in Atlanta... Some kind of virus, maybe... and the windows are shut. One day you wake up and the world has changed. Whatever it is, it's quite fast. Whole cities have gone to run... and returned to their own yards overnight. Those who fell became like them... and added to their numbers. The government tried to stop it. They failed... but they ended up like they came unstuck. Those that underwater did their best to survive... but they had to learn a few things. If there's just one legitimate way to get away from the threat... the workers can't be killed... or destroy their body... or even just destroy their water... they don't get any beds. The problem is how often they travel in packs, like herds of hungry animals. Sometimes dozens sometimes more. There's no room for that. The epidemic has reached the West Coast. The walkers have arrived. The world has changed. It belongs to the dead now. Let's make our move right now. Alright guys, well as I mentioned the epidemic has come out here to the West Coast. It was starting to invade the studio. Luckily we had a group of security guards who have survived. Now they are helping to hold down the fort and their sunk out in this next area. However, they are getting a little, well trigger happy lets say. They pretty much will shoot anything that moves and that may include you. Now it looks like, oh no, something must have happened. It looks like the news around here, they are covering something here. Who knows what is going to happen guys but you know what I don't know. You know what I don't think you can go any further just up here. I think we should let them, hey Tammy can we let these guys out here. We are going to be just fine. If I say we I just mean you because I am not getting under this vehicle. Alright guys it looks like they are ready for your arrival. The sky is stretching that is a very .. uh oh. Um. there's the security guards just go get them guys to make sure they'll be safe. Alright guys have a great time out there. Now get the hell off my trail. Alright. Now stay together. Alright stay together and meet in one piece. Why didn't we meet outside. Fuck! Ahhh! Ahh! Haha. Haha. Hahaha. I thought that maybe if I walked on all sides of the street or something. Like a man.

This young man suffers from what are called night terrors. These night terrors can produce disturbed and frightened behavior even under test conditions. More conventional sleepwalkers can easily perform mechanical actions they carry out repetitively every day. This woman may look as though she is awake, but in fact she is sleepwalking. She has roused, gone into her kitchen and raided her fridge all in her sleep. This man acts out his dreams. One patient like him tied himself to the bedpost each night to prevent himself from attacking his wife. Evidence from a 1997 poll of over 4,000 people in Britain found that 2 in every 100 experienced some form of night violence. What we're doing here is really defining a third area of being. We're saying there's sleep, there's waking, and there's something that is in between that is not dreaming. This is a state in which there is awake looking behavior, but it's not fully awake. Oh, oh wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, don't do that.\n","The News-Egg crime-fighters help police with manhunts by airing mugshots on our newscasts. For this story, we hit the road with a group of state agents who help get the bad guys off our streets. ...straight up! This is the type of operation officers train for. A police hot stop on a van in Bonita. One of the men inside is a murder suspect. To help make this arrest, National City Police call in an elite team of state parole agents, the Fugitive Apprehension Team. More on this arrest later. The plan for this case is that we are going to go out and we are going to mark these houses. This is how most days begin for the Fugitive Apprehension Team. Everybody's names listed on here. A morning briefing on the fugitives the parole agents are tracking in the field. ...crime, to terrorize, DV, position of explosive device, and drug-related offenses. First stop on this day, a surveillance operation in Lemon Grove. We're just waiting for S1 to come out in any vehicle. The News 8 Crime Fighters ride along as six agents keep an eye on the house where a friend of the suspect lives. We've got him for burglary and a robbery, but we don't know what other crimes he may have committed. Our chaperone is team supervisor Jim Stager, a parole agent with 28 years experience. Every once in a while, you find somebody who's brain is just absolutely fried and they come out shooting. Suddenly, the friend of the fugitive comes out. The agents followed the driver tracking him to another home. A short time later, the driver takes off at a high speed. Since he's not wanted for a crime, the agents let him go. The team regroups in a parking lot to plan another operation. They're looking for a fugitive sex offender. Agents fan out on a street in Canto where the sex offender is living. They enter with the resident's permission, but no luck. The sex offender is nowhere to be found. Just then, a radio call comes in for that homicide suspect we told you about earlier. Well, they found the brown van in Bonita, so now they're calling for assistance. The team took up with National City Police in a parking lot near a Bonita home where the murder suspect's van has been spotted. The van is on the move and agents scramble to head him off of the path. Alright, they're moving him now. The agents move in working as a team alongside National City Police. Officers have an element of surprise on their side. The man with the bald head is the murder suspect and he surrenders without incident. Three others are taken in for questioning. Because of the actual arrest and the removal of individuals from the van and the clearing of the van, it couldn't have gotten any better than that. Bottom line, nobody got hurt. For Agent Stager, that's a job well-done. These guys are my other family. These are the people that would lay down their life for me. I lay down mine for them. We lay down our lives for strangers. They're the best. Just the best. Five parole agents make up the Fugitive Apprehension Team for all of San Diego County. Two agents from Orange County were also on board the night we rode along.

To the units that are with the three vehicles let's make a plan here. Let's take one of those vehicles, they're gonna be straight south on this two track. Let's make a little path where we can cut them off to the west or to the east so bring a vehicle on that two track and turn left and let's get on the east side of them then we'll put agents on the west side of them and then we'll go in from there. So half of it you make a left and hook them around down the treeline and then the others hold there for just a minute. Okay, you four agents just stay right now on that treeline and follow that treeline south. Yeah you four can go south Go south down the treeline. How many are with the vehicles still? Is there more than one agent? There's going to be two agents. You want more with the vehicles? But we need the ones that are going to make the jump with the vehicle, they'll be closer. Okay, you guys on the east side, you three, you're almost going to be parallel with them. Go another ten yards and stop. Yeah, the agents coming down the west side, this is looking real good. You agents on the east side, you three, stop, where you are. 90 degree right, and they're going to be straight in. Be ready when the jump happens. They're going to come to you if they jump. Agents moving south as a team of six, 20 yards to your left. Watch your radio. You're going to be getting close. Keep coming down. Let me jump up so I can turn my lights on. Okay, you guys coming south. You've got bodies ten yards into your left, and then about ten yards forward and in. There you go, keep coming. Okay, fan out right there and go straight in, left, straight in, left. That's where your bodies are. They're all in there. Straight in. Spread out pretty wide. Yep, you got some right there to your left, the group, and then keep pushing in. There'll be more. You got runners coming to the east side. They're actually going south. Got two runners going south now. South, now they're going east. Just go parallel them down the two track. They're staying in the trees. But just, there you go guys. You're paralleling them. Keep running down the two track. Keep running down the two track. No, don't turn in yet. Keep going south. You guys, you two on the east side, keep running south. You're paralleling them. Keep going.

To the agent walking one out, there's one behind you laying down. You're walking one out, there's one back behind you laying down. It's real thick, I can barely see, but go back to where you were.

You should see his feet. Low and to your right. Low and to your right. There's another agent on top of him now. He's laying out. There, you go. Right there. Do you see him in there?

Agent that had your arm up, walk south on the two track about five yards for me and stop. Walk south on the two track. Keep walking south. Keep walking south. Stop. Right there. Turn right and go straight in. He's going to be prone. It's just real tough to see him, but go straight in from where you are. Agent walking up behind the mobile unit. Oh, you have a body. Never mind. I'll get somebody else. You guys, just walk straight in and you'll be on him. We've got agents walking in from the east side now. You two, if you can find a way in there. Y'all are the closest. Yeah, okay. The unit that's... the agent that's behind the control unit on the west side, stop. Yes, you! You're even with the body. You can move east. Move straight in. Okay, the agent that's coming from the east, go right a little bit. Straight in. More to your right. This agent closer to us. Turn right. Now, go straight west. I know it's thick in there.

If you can, move north along that tree line for me. Okay, you two agents, you're straight in now. If you can go straight in towards the original jump it's getting back to about four o'clock. I'm just probably twenty yards north of the patrol vehicles. Oh, okay, twenty yards north. Yeah, ten-four. Got ya. Got good line now, ten yards. Good line, ten yards. Okay, go a little to your left.

I used it my walking holiday in the Andes in South America. It was made by an Aztec tribe. A dead plant. That's not being watered since December the 15th. It once had long, purple leaves and its red berries are used for cough medicine. Some teeth and a glass? Oh, they belong to great aunt Gertrude. Last worn on Saturday night at a beauty party. They're kept in a glass of lemonade. That is a scrubbing brush. Made in Lancashire. It's wooden with 87 tufts of natural bristle. And I have never used it. Put your hands on your skulls because here come the questions. Where was the scrubbing brush made? Where was the red team? Lancashire. Lancashire. You've lit up an eye. When was the plant last watered? Green. Where was the green team? December 15th. Correct. Well done, well done. Well done. On which continent was the walking stick used? Green. That is the green team. South America. Correct. Where were the teeth last worn? Red. That was the red team. Saturday night. Where? To a beauty party. Correct. What colour were the plant's leaves?

You have now opened up a door to a haunted room, inside that room there is a terrible task. If you complete that task, you will be awarded two eyeballs. If you fail that task, the eyeballs will go to the red team. The choice is yours. Do you wanna go in there and try and complete the task, or do you wanna send them in? Play. You're gonna play? Let's go to the shrinking room. Yoo-hoo. Hello. Great-aunt Gertrude here. Behind me are some stone slabs, and on the back of the slabs are some arrows. What the little darlings have to do is place those slabs on the floor with the arrows point to make a path that leads out of the room. They've got two minutes to do it, and I've laid the first one for them. Should their path be, hmm-hmm, broken in any way, then they have to repair it. So, watch out for those walls. A turn of the... Now, don't forget you gotta cross this line. In you go. I'm not going in there. You've got two minutes to get out of this door, starting now. Right, where you gonna go? Where's that one gonna go? Put it down in there. Don't forget, it's point to point. Point-to-point. This is for two eyeballs. Ooh, that's a good one. Point to point. Clean it up, clean it up. There you go. Oh, you got some corkers now. You almost to the door! Watch out for the wall! Right, that one's gotta be laid down, that one's gotta be put down. The wall's coming in! Where you gonna go? What are you gonna do with it? What are you gonna do with it? No, but it's gotta be put down so we can pick another one up and cleaned up. All right, down it goes, down it goes.

Don't forget, you gotta get across this white line. Where? Rebuild it, rebuild it there, clean it up there, point to point, point to point. Don't forget, point to point. Look over there, look over there. You have now, got a minute, exactly a minute to get out. Oh, try to watch out for these, look at that, look at that. It's gotta be done, it's got to get across this line. Two eyeballs, it's the two of them first, it's one balls of the game. Forty five seconds, clean it up over there, over there. Look, it's looking a bit messy, it's looking a bit messy over there, Claire. It's gotta be point to point, like over here, point to point. You're headed off in all sorts of different directions, now, aren't we? Don't forget, you've gotta get across this line in your 30 seconds, it's the two eyeballs. Looks like it's done, yes! You finished! Absolutely superb, I never thought you were gonna get out. Well my little green chickadees were running about like jumping beans in there. I love the way those crushing walls relentlessly demolish their attempts to escape. But they did it in the end, they managed to escape and have won their first two Slippy Slimy Eyeballs. Two to the Greens, none to the Reds yet. There you go, Green Team, your first two eyeballs. Lovely, but don't worry, there are plenty of more Haunted Rooms and plenty of more nerve-racking questions so don't look now. But there appears to be a turnip at the window. Yum yum, my favorite grub. A green sock. I lost the other one last year. Where's it gone? A gingerbread man. Stale, of course. A feather duster. That's never been used in this house as you can tell. An inflatable leg. That's in case I lose my wooden one. Another green sock. Pass me the other sock! To the other green sock. A safety pin. That was on my first-ever nappy. A boomerang. Well, I'll never be able to get rid of that. Right, hands on your skulls because here come the questions. What colour was the sock? Red. That is the red team. Green. Correct. What is the boomerang made out of? Red. Uh, the red team again. Wood. Correct. What was the first object? Red. Ow, the red team again. Planet. Correct. This could be your last question, red team. Concentrate, green team. What was after the second sock? Green. And that is the green team. You know, now I'm gonna have to pass the question over to the red team who are desperate for it. What is it? Safety pin! Incorrect! Well done, then, as you've opened the door to a haunted room. Inside that room there is a terrible task.

Growing up, my love for sports helped me to keep my weight down. It wasn't until after high school that I really began battling obesity, along with a host of medical problems. I saw several doctors who simply sent me home with depression medication and told me to go on a diet. When I married my sweet husband a few years later, I packed on another 60 pounds, putting me at almost 270 pounds. My lowest point came when a doctor told me that we couldn't have children because of my weight and health. No woman wants to hear that. Though I had finally been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism, I used it as an excuse assuming it was my destiny to be fat. I didn't have a big event in my life that made me decide to make a change. I just looked in the mirror one day and wondered why I'd been lying to myself for so long. I asked myself, am I truly happy? Is my marriage thriving? What kind of role model would I be as a mother? I knew I had to make a change, so I braved up and fought back. Now a 130 pound slider and an active runner, I have never been so happy. My marriage is thriving and my energy is incredible. I am proof that it is possible to overcome what may seem like the impossible. Wow, what a doll. Okay, before we ask Emily to come out, we're going to talk with the leader of the Pack Joy Bauer, she is going to tell us more about her eating habits. She is adorable and I love that her newfound passion for health has inspired friends and family to lose weight and increase their health as well. So we're in the midst of the holidays, I wanted to give her some sort of a holiday health So I said, Emily, back in the olden days when you were heavier, what were your absolute favorite fattening fair? Cheesecake! A regular restaurant portion is about 750 plus calories. The palm is bigger than that, it's huge. So I made for her a healthy version. This is a cheesecake dip. It's a fraction of the calories and all I did was, I mixed non-fat cream cheese with a little bit of non-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt, either works. A touch of brown sugar, vanilla extract and cinnamon. And then you can dip it with fruit. And of course, I'll put that out on Twitter and Facebook for our viewers. Next, fettuccine alfredo! What is better than that? This is a heart attack on a plate, right. Over 1400 calories. So in my version for Emily, I took fat-free evaporated, skim milk and I mixed it with a little, light cream cheese and it gives you this creamy, velvety, delicious flavor for a fraction of the calories. Is there pasta in there or is there whole wheat pasta? It's whole wheat pasta. We sauteed mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and some grilled chicken. And you get a hearty portion for under 500 calories. All right, let's look at Emily's. All right Emily, come join the Joy Fit Club! Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! The weight loss took some time. How long did you finally decided that this is the time? How long did it take? It took about a year and a half to two years to lose the weight, but it was probably about a year ago when I really just kicked it into high gear. And you're a runner, you're saying. How did you start that? Slowly. By stepping? Was it a walking thing? Yeah, I couldn't run more than three minutes to start but every day I just went out there and I kept pushing and I kept trying. She gets whistles now. And what does your husband think of this new you? Curtis, you'll get your chance. Curtis is back in the kitchen. Whistling.

The newest member is 27 year old Emily Pollack. Emily's lost a whopping 130 pounds and it changed her life. Let's take a look at her story. I have always struggled with my weight even as a child. Growing up my love for sports helped me to keep my weight down. It wasn't until after high school that I really began battling obesity along with a host of medical problems. I saw several doctors who simply sent me home with depression medication and told me to go on a diet. When I married my sweet husband a few years later I packed on another 60 pounds putting me at almost 270 pounds. My lowest point came when a doctor told me that we couldn't have children because of my weight and health. No woman wants to hear that. Though I had finally been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism I used it as an excuse assuming it was my destiny to be fat. I didn't have a big event in my life that made me decide to make a change, I just looked in the mirror one day and wondered why I had been lying to myself for so long. I asked myself, am I truly happy? Is my marriage thriving? What kind of role model would I be as a mother? I knew I had to make a change so I braved up and fought back. Now a 130 pound slider and an active runner, I have never been so happy. My marriage is thriving and my energy is incredible. I am proof that it is possible to overcome what may seem like the impossible. Wow, what a doll. Okay, before we ask Emily to come out we're going to talk with the leader of the pack, Joy Bauer. She's going to tell us about her eating habits. She is adorable. And I love that her newfound passion for health has inspired friends and family to lose weight and increase their health as well. So we're in the midst of the holidays. I wanted to give her some sort of a holiday health gift. So I said, Emily, back in the olden days, when you were heavier, what were your absolute favorite fattening fair? Cheesecake. A regular restaurant portion is about 750 plus calories. The palm is bigger than that. It's huge. So I made for her a healthy version. This is a cheesecake dip. It's a fraction of the calories. And all I did is I mixed nonfat cream cheese with a little bit of nonfat sour cream or Greek yogurt, either works, a touch of brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. and you can dip it with fruit. Okay. And of course, I'll put that out on Twitter and Facebook for our viewers. Next, fettuccini Alfredo. What is better than that? This is a heart attack on a plate, right? Over 1400 calories. So in my version for Emily, I took fat-free, evaporated skin milk and I mixed it with a little light cream cheese and it gives you this creamy, velvety, delicious flavor for a fraction of the calories. Is there pasta in there? Wheat pasta? It's whole wheat pasta. It's raw, sauteed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and some grilled chicken and you get a hearty portion for under 500 calories. All right. Let's look at Emily's poor picture. All right. Emily, come join the JoyFit Club. Oh my gosh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wow. Good for you, Emily. You look great. Congratulations. Thank you, ladies. All right. The weight loss took some time. How long did you finally decide that this is the time? How long did it take? It took a year and a half to two years to lose the weight. But it was probably about a year ago when I really just kicked it the high gear. And you're a runner you're saying, right? Yeah. How did you start that? Slowly. Walking. Was it a walking thing first? I couldn't run more than three minutes to start. But every day, I just went out there and I kept pushing and I kept trying. She gets whistles now. When she runs. And what does your husband think of this new you? Curtis, you'll get your chance in a minute. Curtis is back in kitchen. Whistling. Whistling at you. How's your energy level changed? In all the health issues that you were concerned about. Amazing. Fertility and things. I have so much energy. It's incredible. I just had a tech up with my doctor recently. Everything was just fantastic. Wow. I was thinking about Grace. So your chances to be a mother some day are much increased. Yes. Such a great thing. Any advice for people at home who are kind of at the before stage at which you were. Any advice for them? Don't rush it. Don't try and push too hard to start with. Take baby steps. It's going to take time. You're going to plateau. You're going to have rough spots. Don't quit. It works and it happens.

They focus on helping maintain a healthy lifestyle free of addiction. Situated in private, tranquil setting just outside of Annapolis, Maryland, Severity Acres is dedicated to your recovery through our unique one on one treatment approach. Therefore, we only accept a limited number of patients at a time. Our private and semi private suites and rooms assure the most comfortable accommodations and our secluded grounds guarantee the most confidential treatment available. Each individuals treatment is personally designed by our team of medical and addiction specialists to enable the best chance at a full, lasting recovery. Because addiction is personal and unique to each person, they need to receive unique treatment as well. Our founder, Lawrence Adler, has been personally touched by addiction and substance abuse issues. After watching people close to him go through numerous treatment programs that were ineffective, he started researching all other options available. What he found is that most treatment programs are strongly grounded in the single treatment philosophy. Because of these shortcomings, he started working with some of the best addiction and treatment specialists to design a different type of treatment option. Thus, Serenity Acres was born. Serenity Acres' treatment options and plans are as different as each of the patients we treat. Incorporating both Eastern and Western medicine, along with proven therapies, we also follow and encourage the 12-step treatment plan to complement all other modalities of treatment, And because addiction is often caused by an underlying emotional or mental issue, we treat not only the addiction, but the underlying causes, which creates a new way for our patients to see life and their role in the world. Serenity Acres offers many recreational activities, including a swimming pool, ping pong, billiards, shuffleboard, horseshoes and basketball. Patients also go on recreational outings like bowling, the movies, museums and the zoo, just to name a few. Our belief is that a structured yet customizable program is the best way for our patients to begin a lasting recovery. Patients are encouraged to participate in the activities and therapies that will most help them recover. Because recovery is a journey that affects the whole family, we also offer well-rounded family therapy and education sessions. We believe that the more support and understanding a patient has, the greater their chances for success at recovery. Recovery information often leaves the addict and their loved ones in a broken or fractured state. Our goal is to help both the patient and their families to become whole again. Our program includes the following treatment methods. Individual therapy five times per week, group therapy daily, holistic therapies, sauna therapy, 12-step programs, 30-day, 60-day, 90-day options for treatment or a custom schedule depending on the individual. Aftercare is thorough with a detailed plan and customized to each patient. So, if you are ready to take the steps to finally overcome your addiction and give yourself a chance at a lasting recovery then take the first step towards the place that will help you get there. Call us now at 1-800-335-7440 to learn more about the unique recovery options that we offer and how we can help.\n","¶¶ Oh God, grant me the serenity To accept the things that I cannot change The courage to change the things that I can The wisdom to know the difference Oh God, give me the courage To love with an open heart To love with an open heart To love with an open heart I wanna love with an open heart Oh, with an open heart I wanna love with an open heart\n","A lot of people feel like with Joy Behar leaving, they're losing their sister. And she has been there since the beginning. And now Joy Behar, the last original member of The View besides Barbara Walters, is leaving the show. Now, we spoke exclusively with Behar this morning, just moments ago. She tells us, quote, I've put in 16 years and felt the time was right. You're doing a great job today. For a decade and a half, her unique wit. If anyone knew how much Nooky elected officials get we'd be calling Tiger Woods, Senator Wisdom. If people don't get real, we're gonna have the same problem next time and willingness to get well a little wild. Oh man, there's been Japan has brought joy to millions of viewers. But this morning, Joey Behar says she's ready to hang up her coffee mug. What'd I say? Talk to the hands. Later this summer, she'll sign off of a B. C. Signature mid morning broadcast after 16 seasons calling it the right time to say goodbye. Behar has been there since the View launched in 1997. She has been at the center of so many memorable moments from her decision to walk off the set and protests during an interview with Bill O'Reilly to her over the top interviews with President Obama. What's the controversial sex book that's on millions of women's bedside tables? It doesn't know. I don't know that. OK, next. Right sense of humor and amusing mannerisms even earned her the ultimate form of flattery. Being regularly spoofed on Saturday Night Live. You want to say who cares?

On Thursday, she told deadline com quote. I have a lot of friends there and I will miss everyone I've worked with because we have a family there. So after 16 years Bay Har is spreading her wing.

On the other side something unexpected an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was a lost family member perhaps The trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew Elephants Some scientists believe elephants can grieve their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find They fall strangely silent as they fondle the bones It's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds, but such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence Only a fully conscious being can think in such a way Another herd arrives. Immediately our group sets out to greet them For the calf it's his first meeting with distant relatives There is huge excitement as the two families meet The calf is still learning his place in the elephant community Our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society, everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth, one thing we can be sure of dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","My father never said anything. He went to the fields and joined the Jihad. If you are to be killed, then don't you join the Jihad? Two children died. One just suffered from eating, the other died of hunger. The other was agitated and really old. We are just waiting for justice to be served. The parents were disappointed, he committed suicide. He was chasing me and they just killed him. They asked me to keep my kids away from me. They then told me I was a widow I don't know how to protect the children, I don't know when I'll recover. I didn't understand their conditions. They murdered my kids to give me food.\n","I think we live in a society here where people don't really want to accept death. And I try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away about five months ago, and he was an avid runner, he was a cook. So this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors. Opening up doors into your subconscious. Me, using these symbols and using the colors and using the things that I know were close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well, I obviously have experienced my own deaths. And I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know, I want to do a workshop and I developed this one. Using the traditional ofrenda altarp making of Mexico. And creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted.

It can take months, even years, to come to grips with the loss, and in some cases the trauma is so severe that special help is needed. New Jersey Resident Stephanie Moldberg is sharing her very personal story to help others. My son Eric loves sports. He was a funny little boy. He had a lot of friends. He was really kind and sensitive, and he was a happy child. Eric had a wonderful relationship with his sister. They were just 18 months apart, and they spend a lot of time together. And Lauren idolized Eric. So whatever Eric did, she wanted to do. We initially found out that Eric was sick a few weeks after he got home from sleep away camp. He was away for seven weeks, and he came home. And when he got home, he was complaining about pain in his hip. But then a couple of weeks later, it started to become more and more painful. We took him to the doctor. It was a tumor. It was stage four metastasized Ewing sarcoma bone cancer. And they had metastasized to his bone marrow, and we had a long road ahead of us. And I just couldn't believe that the diagnosis of cancer. I mean, kids just don't get cancer. So I sort of just had to move into a different gear. And there's so many doctors that we had to speak to. I was Eric's advocate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. My husband and my daughter didn't believe that Eric was going to die. For me, it was different. I thought that he was going to die when we got the diagnosis. And then the last day, he really didn't speak at all. And Eric's laying down. It's about 10 o'clock at night, and I get into bed. And I'm looking at him like I always did, and I spend a lot of time just staring at him. And then I heard this really deep breath. It was almost like he was just trying to keep on breathing. But actually, it was just saying, I can't do this anymore. And that was Eric's last breath. No, there was a lot of planning after Eric died and funeral was just two days later, and then we sat. And there are a lot of people around. But shortly after that, when everybody sort of leaves and my daughter went back to school, my husband went back to work. I was home by myself a lot, and I didn't know what to do. And everything was foreign to me because for pretty much 16 months I didn't do very much but take care of Eric. And I didn't know how to sort of readjust to life and to reengage in life again. And my days were very, very long. And there was no structure to them. And what happens with people that have a difficult time adjusting after their loss is that they feel like they get stuck in time. That their grief is not progressing. And my grief wasn't progressing. Stephanie was suffering from a condition called complicated grief. It's an intense form of grief that needs specialized treatment. And with us this morning is Stephanie Maldburg and Dr. Catherine Sherr, founder of the Complicated Grief Program at Columbia University. First of all, thank you so much for sharing your very personal story with us. Let's talk about how you even were diagnosed, because it was a long road to even get there. It took me four years to get diagnosed. Actually it was my daughter, she had been seeing a doctor who had seen Dr. Sherr lecture at Columbia University. And Lauren's doctor recognized that I had many of the symptoms that Dr. Sherr had been describing, in complicated grief. And she asked Lauren if I could. She can call, contact me, and she did. And then the following week I had an appointment and I met Dr. Sherr. Dr. Sherr, let's talk about the difference between complicated grief and the grief that many of us are familiar with. Yeah. So I think it's useful to think about loss, losing a loved one, as being a little bit like getting a serious physical wound. In that there's a natural healing process that occurs and it's painful, but the pain diminishes as the healing goes on. And sometimes we know a wound can get complicated. Right? It can be, there can be an infection or trouble with the vascular supply or something like that and when that happens you have to treat the complication to let the wound heal. And the same thing can actually happen with grief. It can get complicated so that it doesn't do that natural healing. And Stephanie was talking about some of the symptoms that, and we put those up on the screen. There are so many different symptoms. Stephanie, let's talk about how the treatment has helped you. It's a 16 week program? Yes. It was very time limited and very structured. And I had been in therapy before but I was avoiding talking about the most difficult things. And that was my loss. And when I met Dr. Cher there was a very, she was very guided and she kept me on track. And I had, I did imaginal revisiting exercises and conversations. Those were really two very helpful tools for me. It helped me progress. And I was so fearful that I was going to forget Eric and the memories that I had of him. And doctor, the person who is going through complicated grief, I'm guessing that person very often does not recognize that in themselves. What advice do you have for people around them that may see it? Well, you know, people gather around people after they lose someone close. They just do that naturally and they provide a lot of support and emotional and practical support, and they don't expect it to be over right away. But, you know, when it starts to, people notice when someone else, months and months have gone by and someone is still experiencing intense, intense emotions and it's disrupting their lives. And their natural inclination at that point is to say, you know, honey, I know this was hard, but, you know, it's time to move on and put this behind you. But we can't put a loss behind us. We have to learn to live with it. And so, you know, really what other people need to realize is that when a person isn't doing that, it's not because they don't want to. It's because there's something really stopping them. And that's, you know, that's when they kind of need help, rather than just pushing, you know? Well, Dr. Shear, thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie, you were saying that Dr. Shear really saved your life. Thank you, Mill. I thought so. Thank you. Now, for more information about complicated grief, head over to our website, cbsnewyork.com. We're back in a moment.\n","It wasn't real. So, I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And I mean we don't really think about it but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance. Oh my god, is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. It just doesn't make sense. No, it does. No, it's not over. I have four years of college to go through. It will be exactly the same. No, it will be completely different. Oh my god, is it really over? Is school really over? Yup. Like I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean school is a part of the real world but I'm assuming that you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case, yeah. No. Come fall semester, I'm just going to show up at any class that I want to. What are they going to do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? It's not a bad thing. I'm not leaving my room until I'm 35 and nursing a child. This sucks. I have to get a real job now! If you want money. I don't need money or material things, all I need is friends and a family. Don't you think you're being a little unrealistic? Don't you think you're being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I don't like new things! I don't do new things! Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay, it's okay. I mean I'll have all the same friends that I do now. I mean we'll stay in touch no matter what. You won't. It's okay, I'll just go to grad school. I mean it's not that expensive. You could do that, I mean if you don't think you're ready for serious employment, go back to school, learn more. Perfect, I just won't turn 30. And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god, everyone's gonna be so far away and I'm gonna be alone! I'm gonna have to talk to people! Yeah, that's kind of something we humans do. I don't have money, how am I supposed to do this?! Student loans? Okay, maybe I'll just hope for a big student loan and I'll spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought. Wow, I forgot about those student loans. I can't afford graduate school, I have to get a job. I hate milkshakes! Ahahaha. Yeah, about that, you'll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. I'm too old to get away with stuff now. Life goes on. I guess I'll just be popular in college. I guess it is over. I'm too old to freeload. Life goes on. But I am still really pissed that there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen, damn it! And yes, I said penis and vagina. They're not bad words, they're body parts. It made me think that just because I graduated college, I should put my hair up. Over it.\n","Elsword Animation Come on, wait up. Who are you? You're... Roxas. How can you be here? Am i dreaming? Come on say something. This could have been the other way around. Huh?

It's been hard to sleep because I usually sleep sometimes with my dad. I feel like my mom is with me because she is an angel. What I'd like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes. And sometimes I dream about him. While my brother was riding a bike, he was hit by a texting driver. The advice I would give to kids who have lost a loved one is talking to people doesn't hurt it actually really helps. What I want people to know is that it's really hard, but you'll get through it. And I know you can. Advice I would give is don't keep it in. You need to talk to someone, because it will just keep building in. It feels like he's everywhere I go, even if he's gone. I just love him so.\n","Who are you? Lillian Jones. I won't hurt you. Please. Maybe. I know you. I'm so sorry. I love you. Goodbye.\n","Come on Rottex. What's the matter? What's wrong?

On the other side something unexpected, an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth, but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was A lost family member perhaps The trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew Some scientists believe elephants can grieve Their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find They fall strangely silent as they fondle the bones It's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds But such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence Only a fully conscious being can think in such a way Another herd arrives Immediately our group sets out to greet them For the calf, it's his first meeting with distant relatives There is huge excitement as the two families meet The calf is still learning his place in the elephant community Our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society Everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth One thing we can be sure of Dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","They lived their life with hatred...

And i try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away. He died 5 months ago and he was an avid runner, he was a cook, so this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors, opening up doors into your subconscious. To me, using these symbols and using the colors and using the things that i know or close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well I obviously have experienced my own deaths and I really did some artwork. I did a painting about 10 years ago and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know I want to do a workshop, and I developed this one using the traditional ofrenda altar making of Mexico and creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother, she's been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom, and the wheat, the staff of life. It's very easy for us as children to pull out crayons, markers, and pens and just start marking up the walls, and we really don't have a sense of judging ourselves in those moments. It's natural.

Well, Dr. Scheer, thank you for the help and for all the work that you do. And Stephanie, you were saying that Dr. Scheer really saved your life. Thank you. My life better. Thank you. Now, for more information about complicated grief, head over to our website, cbsnewyork.com. We're back in a moment.\n","It wasn't real. So I was thinking about the fact that people are graduating now, and it made me think back to when I graduated both high school and college. And, I mean, we don't really think about it, but we definitely go through the stages of grief. For instance... Oh my God, is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. It just doesn't make sense. No, no, it's not over. I have 4 years of college to go through. It'll be exactly the same. No, it'll be completely different. Oh my God, is it really over? Is school really over? Yep. Like, I have to be a part of the real world now? I mean, school is a part of the real world. But I'm assuming you mean becoming an adult and having more responsibility. So in that case, yeah. No come fall semester, I'm just gonna show up at any class that I want to. What are they gonna do? Probably make you leave. This sucks! Why do I have to pass all my classes? It's not a bad thing. I'm not leaving my room until I'm 35 and nursing a child! This sucks! I have to get a real job now? If you want money. I don't need money or material things. All you need is friends and family! Don't you think you're being a little unrealistic? Don't you think you're being a little annoying? Can I just like stay back? I don't like new things. I don't do new things. Change is inevitable and necessary. Relax. Okay it's okay. I mean I'll have all the same friends that I do now. I mean we'll stay in touch no matter what. You won't. It's okay. I'll just go to grad school. I mean it's not that expensive. You could do that. I mean if you don't think you're ready for serious employment, go back to school. Learn more. Perfect. I just want to turn 30. And here I thought you were being reasonable. Oh my god everyone is going to be so far away and I'm going to be alone. I'm going to have to talk to people. Yeah that's kind of something we humans do. I don't have money. How am I supposed to do this? Student loans. Okay, maybe I'll just hope for a big student loan, and I'll spend all of it on milkshakes and kegs. Hold that thought! Wow, I forgot about those student loans! I can't afford graduate school! I have to get a job! I hate milkshakes! Yeah, about that. You'll be paying those for decades. I guess it is over. I'm too old to get away with stuff now! Life goes on... Guess I'll just be popular in college. I guess it is over. I'm too old to freeload. Life goes on... But I'm still really pissed there was no such thing as popular in college. I was prom queen, damn it! And yes I said penis and vagina. They're not bad words. They're body parts. 9- 10 years later... And what made me think that just because I graduated college, I should put my hair up? No. Over it.\n","Come on, wait up. Who are you? You're...Roxas!? How can you be here? Am I dreaming? Come on, say something! This could have been the other way around. Huh? But it really has to be you. What do you mean? There are so many hearts that are connected to yours. You're me, so you can feel what I felt. No! Roxas, you're you. We're not the same. I wanted to tell you that. That you deserve as much as I do to be your own person. Sora, see? That's why it has to be you. Not again. Did they cause all this pain? What do you want me to see!? Sora... Don't chase the dreams. They'll lead you nowhere. Just believe in the gifts that you'll never be able to wake up from.\n","you.4\n","Shades of Noir Grief means... every emotion, I think. I felt really sad and didn't want to do anything or talk again. I figured I had to talk. It's been hard to sleep because I usually sleep sometimes with my dad. I feel like my mom is with me because she's an angel. What I'd like people to know is that it can be really hard sometimes. And sometimes I dream about him. While my brother was riding a bike, he was hit by a texting driver. The advice I would give to kids who have lost a loved one is talking to people doesn't hurt and it actually really helps. What I want people to know is it's really hard but you'll get through it. I know you can. The advice I would give is don't keep it in. You need to talk to someone because it will just keep building in. It feels like he's everywhere I go. Even if he's gone, I just love him so.\n","Who are you? William Jones. Good morning, Adam. I wont hurt you. Please. But baby, you look fabulous. I knew you. I'm so sorry. Goodbye. You\n","Come on, Protect. What's the matter? What's the matter? I understand. It's too difficult for you.

There is a giant gorilla with a tiny, tiny, tiny helpless kitten and being gentle and loving towards that kitten. Coco rhymed a name for her new kitten. She called him all ball, because to her the cat looked like a little ball. Coco adored all ball and they spent countless hours playing together. And yet it was by loving the little tailless kitten that Coco learned one of life's hardest lessons. One evening, all ball was tragically killed on a nearby logging road. Coco was heartbroken. All ball, hit by a car... I went in right away. I said, Coco, something's happened to your kitty and he won't be here anymore. You know, he's... he's... the cat has died. Penny stayed with Coco to comfort her. And later, privately, Coco expressed her grief.\n","Choir singing\n","poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores poor dog sores\n","I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart Down in my heart And I'm so happy, so happy, so very happy And I'm so happy, so happy, so very happy For being And I can understand And I can pretend That this will be alright in the end So I'll try my best\n","[\"Taeb Tataab\"] [\"Taeb Tataab\"]\n","Carter!

Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? If I don't belong with you Sometimes I know that differences seem chasms we must spend Sometimes you feel you're falling in and grasping for a hand You try to cross the great divide Or trek that you must choose You're caught up in the landslide It's how I'm lost for you Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? Tell me, where do I belong? If I don't belong with you What do you want? If I don't belong with you What do you want?

If I don't belong with you\n","One last hurdle lies ahead the back is steep and slippery made it On the other side something unexpected an elephant corpse Elephant graveyards may be a myth but death holds a strange fascination for them The hovering foot seems to be trying to deduce who this was a lost family member perhaps the trunk seeks clues from smell It's as though they're paying homage to someone they once knew So some scientists believe elephants can grieve their actions certainly suggest they're deeply moved by what they find they fall strangely silent as they fumble the bones it's difficult to imagine what's going on in their minds but such an interest in death suggests a recognition of their own existence only a fully conscious being can think in such a way another herd arrives, immediately our group sets out to greet them for the calf it's his first meeting with distant relatives there is huge excitement as the two families meet the calf is still learning his place in the elephant community our spy in the herd has given us a sense of what it's like to be born into such a complex animal society everything we've witnessed suggests that we have spent time with some of the most advanced creatures on earth one thing we can be sure of Dumbo is certainly far from dumb\n","She has no words but cries. My father didn't tell us anything. He had voted for poison. Whoever has to die, they don't come from Jihad. Both the sons died because of poison. Some die from hunger, Some die from cough. We are only yearning for peace. My wife passed away, after comitting suicide by poison. I am left with nothing. People tried to keep the kids away from me. They told me I would be a widow then. My life depends on God now. God knows I would die one day. I committed suicide, but I can't lose my family. And new books have been written the people of a wailing earth The wailing is the country of Punjab The wailing is the country of Punjab Out of the ecstasy of those tears, my sister writes my name Today hundreds and thousands of daughters are weeping and they call me the heir of Glory Today the eyes are tears of Glory of that, who I once was\n","I think we live in a society here where people don't really want to accept death. And I try to connect us with that reality. I think a lot of participants are just basically trying to understand the process of grief when they come to this kind of workshop. I'm working on an offering for my cousin who passed away five months ago. But he was an avid runner, he was a cook, so this is kind of one way of saying my goodbyes. Art therapy is like opening up doors, opening up doors into your subconscious. To me, using the symbols, and using the colors and using the things that I know were close to him helps me to feel that process and to understand the process. I know he would love this. Having skulls and skeletons in your ofrenda is an important aspect. It helps you move into understanding that death is part of life. It's nothing to fear. Well, I obviously have experienced my own deaths, and I really did some art work. I did a painting about ten years ago, and it was really honoring the people I knew that had died with cancer. It was just very emotional for me that I could paint that. So I started to think, you know, I want to do a workshop, and I developed this one, using the traditional ofrenda altar making of Mexico, and creating my own little template on how I could create a workshop that clients and participants could experience. It was just so transformational for me when I painted. I created my ofrenda to honor my mother. She's been gone for years. The pearls symbolize wisdom, and the wheat the staff of life. It's very easy for us, as children, to pull out crayons, markers, and pens and just start marking up the walls. And we really don't have a sense of judging ourselves in these moments. It's natural. And I enjoy using art therapy with most of my participants because I feel it's a wonderful expression and vehicle for them to process their emotions.\n","Good afternoon, and welcome to our talk tonight.\n","Unnamed: 248\n","Oh his phone hangs between your breaths I hope you haven't pulled it yet And if this little finger doesn't have the strength Then I'm scared that this bird's backbone breaks It's only hope that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is never running dry I wear a ring of your lipstick Around the knuckle of my fourth digit It reminds me what our bodies sewed It will go through until we are betrothed It's only hope that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Space between your navel In your waistband was the ice Where two fingers pirouette But now these handnails they just slice It's on the hardwood that springs eternal And that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart Is never running dry Never running dry Your tongue that's high, your lips, the shore I am the jets, I'm overboard, Goodbye, courage I christen all the ships that sail, I'm your little kiss, your saliva trail Goodbye courage, hell of sadness again Farewell memories Of new highs and lows Goodbye courage, hell of sadness Hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why This dripping from my broken eye Is never running dry Hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why My broken heart is never running dry I let those forefingers got me Leave me only with my thunder Constantly is pointing down me Emperor besties not friends It's only hope that springs eternal But that's the reason why This dripping from my broken heart is Never running dry Never running dry\n","Puppy Surprise is having puppies!

How fortuitous, he says, for a species to find in its own ability to contemplate, to marvel at its own existence, has been evolutionarily advantageous. In other words, it has been biologically selected for because it informs our life with a sense of cosmic significance, that makes us work harder to persist and to survive. In other words, awe has helped us survive. And you know, a recent study out of Stanford on the subject of awe kind of validates this idea. They have found that regular incidences of awe leave residual benefits upon the individual that persists, such as increased feelings of empathy and compassion towards others, increased feelings of altruism, and increased feelings of general well-being. In this study, they defined awe as an experience of such perceptual expansion. Such perceptual vastness that you literally have to reconfigure, upgrade your mental schemata just to accommodate, just to take in the scale of the experience. This is amazing. We've all felt this before, the first time we've stared upon the Grand Canyon or succumbed to the immersive power of an IMAX film, but perhaps the most exquisite account of the experience of awe was articulated by the brilliant Ross Anderson when writing about the Hubble Space Telescope. Pay attention, he says that the Hubble has given us nothing less than an ontological awakening, a forceful reckoning with what is, allowing us to contemplate space and time on a scale just shy of infinite. Wild! He says gazing upon the famous Deep Field photograph literally allows us to mainline the whole of time through the optic nerve, to fit something so impossibly large to something so impossibly small. Simple. Incredible. He says through the sheer aesthetic force of its discoveries the Hubble distills the impossibly complex abstractions of astrophysics into these singular expressions of color and light, vindicating Keith's famous couplet, beauty is truth. Truth. Beauty.\n","USGS position target is leaving the building. Over. We'll have eyes on target in one second. Eyes on target now. Target wearing violet top, black skirt, black satchel.

What is the difference? Let's just stay on taxes for a moment. Well but virtually everything you just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. This is about getting jobs for the American people. Jim let me just come back on that on that point which is the small businesses were talking about. Excuse me, just so everybody understands, we're way over our first 15 minutes. Fun isn't it? It's okay it's great. That's all no problem. Jim the President began this segment so I think I get the last word. You're going to get the first word in the next segment. Well but he gets this first word of that segment. Way over the two minutes. Sorry. Putting it forward before Congress right now $4 trillion plan. But you've been president four years you've been president four years make one more point. Let me answer the taxes thing for a moment. Okay. Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He's ruled out revenue? Absolutely. Look Medicaid, schools, oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. But it's real but but the right the right approach is running May... And you don't support that? I don't. Yeah again that's for future I understand. Not for current retirees. Jim if I can just respond very quickly not just in Medicare and Medicaid. Talk about that. But overall. And so... That's that's a big topic... I want to get to it but all I want to do quick very quickly before we leave the economy. Let's get back to Medicare. The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost but my experience my experience is that private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. Can we, can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between you on Medicare? All right. Regulation can become excessive... Is it excessive now do you think? Well in some places yes, other places no. It can become out of date. Leverage limits for institutions... Here's a specific... Let me mention the other, let's talk here the big one... Let's not... But that's not what I believe... That's just not the facts. Now the last point I'd make before... Two minutes is up sir. No I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me... Leaving millions of people out in the cold... Your five seconds went away a long time ago... Well I did with my first statement and I'll go on... Please allow me... These are tough problems and we've got to make choices and the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country. We're gonna move to... Which is which is my experience... They're setting up their training programs... Do you agree, Governor? Let me just finish the point... I suspect it will be very well in my state, by the way... Yeah... We're running out of time... Any chances to respond to that... Mr. President, you're entitled for all of our kids... All right gentlemen, look... Excuse me one second... Excuse me sir... We barely have three minutes left for now... From the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lara... Thank you and good night.\n","this is Lincoln that has snuck up on the bed and now I'm going to try to get him down and you will see what I have to go through every time to try to get him off the bed get down get down get off this bed get off this bed get down get down get down get down don't you growl you get down it's time to wake up you get off the bed it's time to work diggin you just ignore me okay dink you take you get off the bed excuse me excuse me okay wake up okay wake up maybe you'll get off\n","It's okay.

This teacher has a particular student named Chelsea. Chelsea loves Justin Bieber. Tried to buy tickets, they were sold out. Parents tried to buy tickets, they were sold out. The teacher even wanted to try and buy tickets for Chelsea too. Couldn't get a hold of any, so now Chelsea's grade-eight class have been trying to win her tickets from us every single morning and every single afternoon so we've decided to come here and surprise Chelsea and tell her that she's going to Justin Bieber. We have a pair of tickets for her. Now this is super stealth mode, we couldn't come in the Virgin vehicle because everybody would see so we're driving my old blazer, 2000 blazer.. sweet ride.. no one will suspect a thing, although there's four of us in here and the windows are fogging up, but so we're gonna go to the office get the teacher and then Jamie who's recording right now is gonna go into the class pretend that he's helping record some huge announcement when we bust in yo with Bieber tickets. Yeah Chelsea we're coming for you. Don't stop believing. So here's the notorious miss Greenberg who wrote the email telling us about the lovely Chelsea. So here's the background in about what is it 10 minutes or so we're gonna call it a meeting of sorts where we're gonna have about 70 people in a room, you didn't know how to lie to your students? Right. So what did you tell them? I told them that there was a possibility of one of their teachers leaving next week and I managed to put on some fake tears for them so they think that that person is me so they are all prepared for the absolute worst. That's good that's good. That is a horrible story. A horrible lie but good. So tell us a little bit about Chelsea and why you wanted to make sure she got Justin Bieber tickets? Chelsea is the best kid ever she is in French she's what we call the little chouchou she does anything to make anybody happy she is a psycho Justin Bieber fan like it's ridiculous you know like we'll be writing math tests and there will be a question that has nothing to do with Justin Bieber and she will find a way to incorporate him into her answer. She's just, she's a really lovely kid she goes above and beyond with everything she does and she's just so deserving of this and the kids have been trying so hard, the whole class has been trying so hard to help her win these tickets. And so let's say that this is grade eight yeah these are 13 going on 14 year olds so I think that's really amazing you're right that's so rare you have like a whole class of kids that are pulling together to send somebody to go They're all actually wearing purple today because they wanted to take a picture and photoshop Justin Bieber into it and send it to the radio station at lunch as a whole class wearing purple to try and You are kidding? there's 19 kids wearing purple right now oh my gosh yeah I'm so excited I could get sick do you know what I mean there's like so many nerves here I've been feeling like that since last night I haven't slept all night because I'm I've just been so excited for this kid there is gonna be one less lonely girl Chelsea's going to Justin Bieber thank you very much okay let's go do this Good Morning I'd like to introduce Jamie Morning hi guys We have something to share with you Miss Greenberg indicated that this meeting was very important to something so Where is Chelsea? Chelsea Where is Chelesea AHHH Chelsea, hi Chrissy this is LTI So we are so You guys We are so impressed We think you guys are the best You guys are so amazing The fact that you would be so supportive Of one of your friends, we see that you guys are wearing purple And we love you, because you guys are gonna Photoshop a photo Just for us to say hi And you're gonna say it just for me All you love All you love All you love All you love Bieber!\n","You Did you forget to jump you alright, buddy did you forget to jump?
