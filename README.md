# EmoVision: Multimodal Emotion Recognition
This project aims to recognize emotions for various different modalities, such as text, audio, and videos. We use several different models, including a bi-LSTM to recognize emotions from text, a CNN to recognize emotions from audio and images, a CNN-LSTM to recognize emotions from video, and various other techniques to compare their results.
